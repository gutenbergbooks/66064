<br />THE BORDER SUITOR&mdash;COONEY JOE.</h2>
<p>The sun was going down behind the western hills in a
flood of yellow light, and a river dimpled on under the
slanting rays, great fish leaping now and then from the placid
surface, and the trees along the bank casting fantastic shadows
into its depths. In a sheltered nook, near a spot where
a little creek joined the river, a settler had built a cabin,
which the hand of woman had beautified and adorned as
only the hand of woman can. Bright flowers bloomed on
each side of the rustic doorway and an English ivy vine
clung to the walls and was rapidly spreading its delicate
tendrils over the whole front. The cabin faced the stream,
and behind it the hand of industry had cleared many acres
which now showed heavy growths of cereals and roots, carefully
cultivated. It was a silvan spot, and one upon which
the eye of the artist would linger long and pleasantly.</p>
<p>The door opened suddenly, and a young girl holding a
water-pail in her hand came out with a free, careless step,
singing a merry song. She was plainly dressed, and yet
there was an air of native grace about her every movement
which plainly showed that she had not always lived amid
such wild surroundings. She was beautiful&mdash;not the vapid
beauty of cities, but that of perfect health, and a free life. Her
form was untrammeled by the fashions which cramp and
deform the beautiful women of our day, and her face, a little
browned by exposure to the to sun, glowed&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;With sunny beauty and rustic health.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>Maud M&uuml;ller&mdash;Whittier&rsquo;s Maud&mdash;was not more beautiful
than this frontier damsel. Not only was her face cut in a
perfect mold, but her eyes sparkled with life and vivacity,
and her sunny hair, unconfined, hung about her shoulders in
beautiful profusion.</p>
<p>She left the river, turned down the creek, entered a little
grove half a mile from the house, passed through it, and
looked across the open field beyond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;are you there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No answer was returned, save the echo of her musical
voice, and she looked about her in evident surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where can he have gone?&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the words left her lips there was a slight rustle in the
bushes by her side, and a man came out and stood beside
her. He was still young, but his strikingly handsome face
bore the marks of a life of dissipation and riot. He was
quite tall, nearly six feet in his moccasins, with a face which
showed unmistakable signs of Indian blood, though somewhat
remote, and a wandering black eye, full of passion.
He was dressed in hunting costume, and held in one hand a
long rifle, and two small protuberances in the breast of his
hunting-coat showed where his pistols lay concealed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I should meet you here, Sadie,&rdquo; he said, quietly.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look very glad to see me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what I think of you, William Jackwood,&rdquo;
she replied, turning quickly away. &ldquo;How dare you to come
here, after what has happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed a low, bitter, chilling laugh, which did not
indicate enjoyment, and his black eyes seemed to emit sparks
of fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would not refer to our last meeting, if I were you,
Sadie,&rdquo; he said, evidently controlling himself by a violent
effort. &ldquo;I was half crazy with liquor that night or I would
not have said what I did. See here; give me a chance to
make this right with you and I&rsquo;ll do it. I want to be a
friend to you&mdash;I do, upon my soul. I&rsquo;ll ask your pardon
on my knees, if you&rsquo;ll forgive, and promise not to lay it up
against me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forgive you,&rdquo; she said, with a cold, passionless glance,
&ldquo;but you must not come here any more, for all that. My
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
father has told me not to have any more to say to you, and
I shall obey him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man stood grinding the butt of his rifle into the soft
earth, and fighting a powerful battle to keep down his heart.
The girl no longer looked at him but took up the pail and
was moving on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a moment,&rdquo; he said, hoarsely. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t part from
you like this, Sadie. You don&rsquo;t know what you are doing
or what will happen if you don&rsquo;t use me more kindly. By&mdash;I
beg your pardon, but I am half mad&mdash;I can&rsquo;t stand it.
Do you know that I worship the ground you tread for your
sake, and would give my life at any moment if it would be
of service to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must not speak to me in that way, Mr. Jackwood,&rdquo;
she said, in a more gentle tone. &ldquo;I am truly sorry for you if
you speak the truth, but I can not listen to you. Aside from
the fact that my father does not like you, I have my own inclinations
to consult, and I do not and never can love you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you love some one else,&rdquo; he cried savagely. &ldquo;All
right; marry him if you dare, but of this be assured&mdash;the moment
you stand up before the minister with <i>any</i> man, if it
were my own brother, I will kill you both where you stand.
Do you hear me?&mdash;I will kill you both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you dare to threaten me in that way, Will Jackwood?
Oh, if my father were here, he would teach you to insult his
daughter in that way. Do you think to frighten me by idle
threats? Since you force me to say it, know that the sight
of your dark face is and always has been odious to me, and
that I will never speak to you again except upon compulsion
under any circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He caught her by the wrist with his disengaged hand
and held her firmly, when she dropped the pail and struck
him full in the face with her open hand. He uttered a cry
like that of an angry tiger, and letting go his hold upon the
gun caught her about the waist with his strong right arm.
Powerless in his grasp, she struggled with all her strength
and screamed for help. The call was not made in vain, for
a quick step was heard, and a heavy body crashed through
the bushes, and Sadie screamed again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Comin&rsquo;, by the mortal, comin&rsquo;!&rdquo; roared a hoarse voice.
&ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>Will Jackwood released her instantly and caught up his
gun, just as a short, thick-set, powerfully-built man darted
from the bushes and stood beside them. He wore the fringed
hunting-shirt and beaded moccasins of the scout and hunter,
and his long, flax-colored hair was crowned by a greasy coon-skin
cap in the last stages of dissolution. The face was a
marvel of native ugliness, but in spite of that he was greeted
with a cry of joy from Sadie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cooney Joe is hyar,&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;What is the matter
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been insulted, Joe,&rdquo; cried Sadie, panting for breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By that yer p&rsquo;ison critter, I&rsquo;ll bet. Now look out, Black
Will, acause I&rsquo;m a-goin&rsquo; to give yer the durndest lickin&rsquo; you
ever got sence yer mammy took ye over her knee. Hyar&rsquo;s
fur ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Black Will could bring his rifle to a level the stout
hunter dashed in and his heart was beating against the broad
breast of the man known as Jackwood. In a moment more
they were locked in a fierce grapple, fighting in true western
style, without the slightest idea of the rules of the ring. In
a stand-off fight, the long arms and powerful build of Black
Will would have given him a decided advantage, but in the
close grapple Cooney Joe was more than his equal, and loosening
one hand by a violent effort he struck his antagonist such
a blow in the face that his teeth seemed to rattle in his jaws,
and he staggered. Throwing himself forward with a victorious
war-whoop, Cooney Joe brought him to the ground, and
the next moment was kneeling on his breast with his long,
brown fingers fastened on his throat in a decidedly uncomfortable
way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yah-h-h&mdash;hip! Got ye that time, my sweet infant!
The old coon kin climb a tree yit. Say the word, Miss Wescott,
an&rsquo; by the big meat pie I&rsquo;ll choke the life clean out of
his pesky karkidge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him go for the present, Joe,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He has
been punished sufficiently, and it will teach him that I am
not friendless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pshaw! don&rsquo;t let him git off that way. Take off his
belt and let me larrup him with it till he <i>howls</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no; don&rsquo;t strike him again. Take away his weapons
and let him go.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; said Black Will hoarsely. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch the
pistols and I promise to go away at once, and not make a
move for revenge to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fair,&rdquo; said Joe, rising. &ldquo;I never knowed the critter
to break a fair promise, Miss Sadie, and you kin trust him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cooney Joe stood up and Black Will slowly arose, with an
expression of fearful malice upon his dark face, slowly brushing
the dust from his clothing without speaking a word.
Cooney Joe had taken up his rifle and stood leaning upon it,
a grin of enjoyment stretching his naturally wide mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curi&rsquo;s how things come &rsquo;round, ain&rsquo;t it? I&rsquo;ve wanted a
lick at you fur nigh onto five year an&rsquo; never got a chance till
now; does me good, this does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you know I&rsquo;ll have your life for it, Joe Bent,&rdquo;
said Black Will, in a quiet tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sartin, sartin, if ye kin git it,&rdquo; replied Cooney Joe. &ldquo;But
don&rsquo;t forgit that ef I see yer hand go anigh a pistil in a
strange company I&rsquo;ll try to shoot first. &rsquo;Member that, don&rsquo;t ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to remember, Joe,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Now, Miss
Wescott, I will say to you what I intended to say when this
meddling fool broke in upon us. You shall never live to be
the wife of another man. If I can not have you, no one else
shall, I swear by every thing I hold true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;isen critter, ain&rsquo;t you, Will?&rdquo; said Cooney Joe, regarding
him with a look of benign interest, as a great natural
curiosity. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be individually an&rsquo; collectively cussed ef you
ain&rsquo;t a nice picter to go a-talkin&rsquo; about marryin&rsquo; a gal like
Miss Sadie. Why, bu&rsquo;st my buttons, ef I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;d
ruther have me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would indeed,&rdquo; replied Sadie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who asked you to speak, Joe Bent?&rdquo; said Black Will,
savagely. &ldquo;Keep your distance and live in safety for twenty-four
hours, but after that I will take your life, no matter
where I meet you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You rare &rsquo;round the awfulest kind, don&rsquo;t ye,&rdquo; replied Joe,
with a merry look. &ldquo;Dash my bacon ef you ain&rsquo;t a study
fur a painter. I&rsquo;ve see&rsquo;d chaps in the theater at St. Louis
that rared &rsquo;round the stage jest as you do now, but somehow
they allus got special hail kolumbia in the end. Now <i>git</i>;
I don&rsquo;t want to say any thing more <i>but</i> git.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Black Will quietly tightened his belt, brought his rifle to
a &ldquo;right shoulder shift,&rdquo; and was off at a long, slinging pace
which carried him rapidly across the field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thar goes a pizen critter, Miss Sadie,&rdquo; muttered Cooney
Joe. &ldquo;Now I reckon he meant jest what he said when he
told me that he&rsquo;d hev my life, but I&rsquo;ve took a good many
chances, though he&rsquo;ll hev my ha&rsquo;r sartin ef I don&rsquo;t shoot first
when we meet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to have brought you into danger, Joe,&rdquo; said
the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry&mdash;danger&mdash;git out! D&rsquo;ye think I keer fur <i>that</i>,
little gal? Why, make it the wust ye kin, the chances ar&rsquo; I
git a shot afore he does, an&rsquo; ef I <i>miss</i>, then it&rsquo;s my own fault.
Whar&rsquo;s yer daddy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came out to find him and bring him some drink. I
thought he was at work in this field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He orter be keerful,&rdquo; said Joe Bent, uneasily, &ldquo;&rsquo;cause the
Injins are gitting r&rsquo;iled up awful, and thar&rsquo;s no tellin&rsquo; when
they may break out. Let&rsquo;s try an&rsquo; find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he is now,&rdquo; cried Sadie.</p>
<p>As she spoke, a middle-aged man, with a hoe across his
shoulder, appeared at the other side of the woods and came
rapidly toward them. As he came near he shouted cheerily
to Joe Bent, who seemed very glad to see him, and they shook
hands heartily. Mr. Wescott had the same air of gentility
which showed itself in his daughter, but, like her, had adapted
himself to his present surroundings, and looked the picture
of a genuine western farmer. In stature he was almost
a giant.</p>
<p>Sadie rapidly recounted her meeting with Black Will, and
all that had passed between them, and the face of Mr. Wescott
darkened, while his hand closed convulsively upon the
handle of his hoe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a lucky thing for the black-hearted scoundrel that
I was not by, Sadie,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;or it would have gone hard
with him. What brings you up this way, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sort o&rsquo; got a hint to git off the hunting grounds from
that pernicious red devil, Napope, who is sp&rsquo;ilin&rsquo; fur mischief.
Ar&rsquo; ye good friends with the Injins, &rsquo;square?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly; I never wronged one of them in my life.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not that it matters much ef they once rise,&rdquo; continued
Joe, &ldquo;because then they won&rsquo;t hev any friends in the white
race. I&rsquo;ve my doubts of that Black Will, anyhow. Two
weeks ago I saw him in the Injin village, an&rsquo; him an&rsquo; that
cussid Napope was ez thick ez flies in sp&rsquo;iled bacon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the trouble with the Indians?&rdquo; said Wescott, uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them cussid agents rob them like thieves,&rdquo; replied Joe
Bent. &ldquo;Ef Black-Hawk would only ketch an&rsquo; burn them, I
don&rsquo;t believe our fellers would kick much, they act so fearful
mean. Do you know that I think the village the best place
fur Miss Sadie, &rsquo;bout this time in the year?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk to you by-and-by,&rdquo; said Wescott, with a quick
glance at his daughter&rsquo;s observant face. &ldquo;Come to the house
and get something to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They quickened their steps and reached the cabin, and
while Sadie set about preparing a meal, they sat outside and
smoked their pipes, talking in low, eager tones. Sadie could
see that their conversation was very important, and, woman-like,
felt piqued that they kept it secret from her, and hurried
her preparations. In a few moments the homely meal
was smoking on the board, and they sat down, enjoying their
food with keen relish; but the two men dropped their conversation,
or rather, changed it to indifferent subjects, much
to the disgust of Sadie. Just as they were about to rise from
the table, she gave utterance to a cry of surprise and ran to
the door, and a moment after appeared, leading an Indian
girl by the hand.</p>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER II.</span>
<br />MINNEOBA&rsquo;S WARNING.</h2>
<p>It was a woman of the Sac nation, but bearing unmistakable
signs of white blood. Her form might almost have
vied with that of Sadie, and her dark skin glowed with perfect
health. Her hair was unlike that of any pure Indian
girl, slightly waving, and with a luster upon it never seen in
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
the pure Indian. Her dress was of the richest description
that was worn by the women of the tribe, and her head was
crowned by a coronet of eagle-feathers, which bespoke the
daughter of a chief. Dainty feet, small hands and delicate
features distinguished the maid from the majority of her race,
and all together, two more noble specimens of native grace
rarely trod the same floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the piper that played while the king danced, if it
ain&rsquo;t Minneoba, the pride of the Sac nation,&rdquo; cried Cooney
Joe. &ldquo;Say, gal, what ye doin&rsquo; &rsquo;round yer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Minneoba has traveled a long path, and she is weary,&rdquo;
replied the Indian girl, faintly. &ldquo;Let the Wild Rose give
her food and drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sadie, who was much taken by the rare beauty of the forest
maid, seated her at once at the table and placed food before
her. She passed over the few dainties which the table
afforded, and ate the most simple food, and her appetite was
soon gratified. Joe whispered aside with Mr. Wescott.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you that the gal is the favorite daughter of Black-Hawk,&rdquo;
he whispered, &ldquo;an&rsquo; she&rsquo;s got some good reason fur
bein&rsquo; hyar. But don&rsquo;t hurry her, for I know the breed and
she&rsquo;s obstinit, durned obstinit, when she hez a mind to,
though she&rsquo;s a good gal, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the mean time the Indian girl was chatting merrily with
her new friend, and her musical laugh rung through the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whisper to Sadie to git her confidence, Mr. Wescott,&rdquo;
muttered the hunter. &ldquo;She kin do it. The gal is open-hearted
as the day, and ef she means friendship she <i>means</i>
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wescott called Sadie aside and spoke to her in a low, hurried
tone, and nodding intelligently, the white girl returned
to the side of the Indian girl, and soon after the two rose and
went out of the cabin, strolling down by the river side. Minneoba
had her fan in her hand, more from habit than any
thing else, and they walked along the green banks, talking
earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Minneoba is the daughter of Black-Hawk,&rdquo; said the maiden,
in answer to a question, &ldquo;and she loves her father well.
The heart of the old man is very sad, for he sees the white
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
men forcing the Indian step by step out of the land their fathers
gave them. Look down and tell me what you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Close to the bank of the stream not far away a succession
of low mounds of different sizes showed where the ancient
grave-yard of a tribe had been. Not far from this a white
village was seen, the farms of the settlers encroaching upon
the graves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we bury the bodies of those we love, daughter of
the white man, it is not pleasant to think that the feet of the
strangers tread upon the graves. The Indians are rough and
rude, but they too love the graves of their fathers, and it
makes them sad to think that the plow of the white man
will disturb the loved remains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very sad, but I have heard that Keokuk sold this
land to our people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keokuk has done wickedly,&rdquo; cried the girl, excitedly.
&ldquo;It is a false Indian who treads upon his father&rsquo;s grave, or
allows the white man to do it. A Sac despises the man who
is so base.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will the Indians do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What they will do is not for an Indian girl to say; their
hearts are very sore, but they would be friends with the white
men, if the white men will let them. But fire-water and bad
men will make trouble in the land. Tell the people of the
village that it would be better for them to give up the Sac
town and build for themselves upon another place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In order to understand the words of Minneoba fully, it will
be necessary to set down the history of the events which finally
drove Black-Hawk to desperation.</p>
<p>By the treaty entered into by the United States upon one
side and the Sacs and Foxes, Siouxs, Omahas, Iowas and
Ottoes upon the other, headed by Keokuk, or the Watchful
Fox, the land of these tribes was sold to the United States.
In this bargain and sale Black-Hawk took no part, but in
spite of that the Indian agents insisted that he should leave
his village, which without his consent had been sold to the
whites, and build another upon the west bank of the Mississippi.</p>
<p>No race love their native land better than the Indian, and
Black-Hawk was of the pure blood. He cursed the traitors
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
who had sold their country, but vowed that he would not
leave his village until compelled to do so by force. Every
little disturbance between wandering white men and the
tribes, every slight affair of whatever kind was magnified and
turned against the Sac chief. Yet he only sought to do what
was right, and prevailed upon Keokuk, who had made the
treaty, to go to the white agents, with whom it had been
made, and offer them in the name of the Sacs the lead mines,
the most valuable property of the Indians, if they might be
permitted to retain their village. The Watchful Fox, satisfied
that he had sold that which was not his own, agreed to go,
and ask for Black-Hawk the little land on which the village
stood, including the grave-yard of the tribe. It was refused.</p>
<p>It was the custom of the western tribes at this date to go
out in winter in a body and have a great hunt. Black-Hawk
went away at the head of his tribe with secret misgivings, and
the village was left unguarded. This was the winter of 1830,
and when the Indians came back from their hunt they found
their village in the possession of the whites, who had taken
advantage of their absence to take possession. The river was
yet full of floating ice, and it was impossible for the Indians
to move, but they sent word to the invaders that before corn-planting
they would drive them out of the village, no matter
at what cost to themselves.</p>
<p>The whites were alarmed, for they felt their inability to
oppose the tribe with their present number. A deputation
was sent to the chiefs, proposing that they should occupy and
plant the land together. The Indians, always generous in
the disposal of land, agreed to the proposal, but upon arriving
they found that the whites had seized and planted the best
of the land.</p>
<p>The peaceful village became one of the most disorderly
upon the frontier. With the whites came in their vices, and
the Indians, naturally weak, began to feel their effects. The
sale of liquor was commenced, and by its aid the whites gradually
robbed the Indians of all that they could call their
own.</p>
<p>The chief saw with alarm what must be the result, when
they received orders to cross no more to the east bank of the
river. The result of such an order may be readily understood,
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
rousing all the fierce passions of the Indians, and in
this state matters stood at the time when Minneoba visited the
cabin of Mr. Wescott.</p>
<p>The Indians were now nearly all upon the west bank of
the river, the chiefs preferring this to longer intercourse with
the white men. These simple men were no match for their
wily antagonists, and had too rapidly imbibed their vices.
Black-Hawk was an Indian, but he had a heart to feel for the
woes of his people, and he saw that only by force of arms
could he hope to succeed in wresting his country from the
hand of the invader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it possible that my father&rsquo;s land belongs to the Indians?&rdquo;
said Sadie. &ldquo;He paid for it honestly, and would not
willingly wrong any man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Wild Rose speaks truly. Her father has a great
heart, but he holds the land which belongs to Black-Hawk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he will pay for it again, sooner than wrong a chief
of the Sacs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Black-Hawk will not sell his lands to a white man. Let
the words of Minneoba sound in the ears of Wild Rose. This
is no place for her to dwell. Let her get a swift horse and
fly away until the tempest has passed, for a dark cloud hangs
over her father&rsquo;s house and threatens her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have done no wrong; why should I flee?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sister, the evil will come to the just and the unjust,
for Black-Hawk will have his land again. Do not ask me to
tell you more, for a Sac maiden can not betray her father,
but take those you love and fly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While yet speaking, the rapid beat of hoofs could be heard,
and two men rounded a point of woods and approached them.
At a glance Sadie recognized Black Will and a desperate ruffian
who was more than suspected of selling arms to the Indians,
a great offense upon the frontier. This man&rsquo;s name
was Richard Garrett, and he was hated and feared all along
the border.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, look!&rdquo; cried Minneoba. &ldquo;Yonder comes a bad white
man, who has spoken evil words in the ears of Black-Hawk.
What does he here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us hurry away,&rdquo; whispered Sadie. &ldquo;He is my enemy,
and I fear to meet him now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>The two girls darted into the bushes, but not quickly enough
to evade the eyes of the two men, who at once urged their
horses and overtook the flying girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, my dear,&rdquo; said Black Will, placing himself in front
of Sadie, and effectually barring her further flight. &ldquo;I did
not expect to meet you so soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not stop me, Will Jackwood,&rdquo; cried Sadie. &ldquo;You
have been punished once to-day for your insolence. Joe Bent
is not far away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is safe from me for this day, for he has my word,&rdquo;
replied Black Will. &ldquo;But, when we meet again, one or the
other goes down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Threats do not hurt the absent,&rdquo; was the quiet reply.
&ldquo;Let me pass at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so fast. I shall not have a better opportunity than
this, and must entreat you to come with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unconsciously, in their walk, the girls had come some distance
from the house, and at that quiet hour few persons were
abroad. Sadie understood the object of Black Will. It was
to seize and carry her away for the purpose of forcing her to
become his wife. He sprung out of the saddle, and menacing
her with instant death if she cried out, hurried toward her,
when a new and unexpected obstacle stood in his path. Minneoba
had been almost unnoticed by the two scoundrels, and
seeing that Dick Garrett was employed in holding the horses,
the brave girl suddenly strung her bow, and fitting an arrow
hastily, sprung in between Black Will and his intended victim,
and he recoiled with a cry of rage, as the bright point of the
arrow glittered in the light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Minneoba, by all the devils! Out of my path, girl, or a
worse thing may come to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Minneoba did not move, her bright eyes fixed upon the
form of the would-be abductor in a way which he did not
like.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sadie is the friend of the Sac girl,&rdquo; she said, quietly.
&ldquo;You shall not touch her while I live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you are doing, mad girl. What
will your father say when he knows that you have aimed an
arrow at my breast&mdash;<i>mine</i>, of all white men in the territory!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be better for Black-Hawk if you had never seen
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
him,&rdquo; replied the girl. &ldquo;Take your horse and go, for I will
spare your life if you do not touch the Wild Rose; touch
her, and you are dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Black Will was a brave man, but he knew well the deadly
skill of the Indian girl, and had seen it proved a hundred
times in sportive encounters in the Indian village. Though
full of rage, he dared not advance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But listen to me, Minneoba,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This girl is
to be my wife; I love her, and would take her into my
lodge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me hear her say that she loves <i>you</i>, and the Sac girl
will not come between you. Stand back, or the arrow flies
from the string.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall suffer for this, girl. Black-Hawk shall know
how his daughter claims for a friend the daughter of the man
who holds his land. We shall see how he likes that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Minneoba can talk to Black-Hawk; she does not need the
white hunter to tell her what to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a bu&rsquo;ster, Will,&rdquo; said Dave Garrett, laughing. &ldquo;I
reckon you had better give it up. Come, little girl, don&rsquo;t be
foolish. Get out of the way, for my sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Minneoba did not move, and the arrow was still ready to
fly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark, Will! There come horses. Let&rsquo;s get out of this
as quick as we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Black Will, shaking his clenched hand at the immovable
figure of the Indian girl, sprung into the saddle, and the two
men rode away at the top of their speed. They were scarcely
out of sight when a party of mounted riflemen came up at a
trot, but, seeing the two girls, they halted, and the leader dismounted
and came toward them. He was a young, handsome
fellow, in a fringed hunting-coat, booted and spurred, and
wearing the insignia of Melton&rsquo;s mounted rifles, to show that
he was captain of scouts. He lifted the cap gracefully from
his head, and bowed low as he approached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Melton of the mounted rifles, by way of introduction.
May I ask if you have seen any thing of a man
known in this region as Dick Garrett?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He rode away five minutes since in company with William
Jackwood.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;The deuce he did! Excuse me, Miss, which way did he
go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sadie pointed out the road, and with a hasty adieu the
young officer bounded into the saddle and the command
went off at full speed, with Melton at their head. Sadie
had noted that his dark eyes had rested admiringly upon her,
and she was herself struck by his noble appearance, and
Minneoba laughed softly. She could see that the two had
met before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young white chief is very brave. Sadie could love
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, you foolish girl,&rdquo; said Sadie, blushing. &ldquo;I
have only seen him twice before, and probably shall never
see him again. Let us return to the house.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER III.</span>
<br />BLACK-HAWK INSULTED.</h2>
<p>They had scarcely reached the house when the sound of
voices could be distinctly heard upon the river and Joe sprung
to the door, from which the stream was plainly visible. A
dozen canoes were upon the water full of Indians, crossing
from the other shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better git out of sight, Minneoba,&rdquo; said Cooney
Joe. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be well for them to see you here unless you
are forced to come out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian girl hurried into the cabin, and went into
Sadie&rsquo;s room. A moment later a tumultuous band of Sacs,
shouting out furious threats against the whites, landed near
the cabin and came hastily toward it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drunk as lords, every man jack of them,&rdquo; said Joe.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to talk sweet to them or thar will be some ha&rsquo;r
raised right about yer. Thar; that&rsquo;s old Black-Hawk himself,
by George. I wonder what he wants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An Indian somewhat advanced in life, and wearing the
usual insignia of a chief of the Sacs, headed the party, and a
word from him stilled the clamorous tongues of the warriors.
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
Mr. Wescott and Joe stepped out to meet them, and
the chief received them by a lofty gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We come for corn,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and my young men are
so angry that they need the hand of a chief. It is hard that
the Sacs must come like thieves in the night to take corn
from their old fields.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is hard indeed, Black-Hawk,&rdquo; replied Mr. Wescott.
&ldquo;I am as much grieved as you can be that this thing has
happened, and upon my word, I hope that you may settle
this trouble peaceably.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you stay on the Sac fields then?&rdquo; replied the
Indian, morosely. &ldquo;The words of my brother are wise, but
they do not agree with his actions. I stand upon Sac ground,
which is <i>not</i> sold and <i>can not</i> be sold unless Black-Hawk
puts his totem on the paper and gives a belt. Why is the
white man here then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bought of a man who claimed the right to sell,&rdquo; said
Wescott, &ldquo;but I am willing to give you a fair price for the
fields, even now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Black-Hawk will not sell his fathers&rsquo; graves,&rdquo; replied
the chief, fiercely. &ldquo;Look; your white men are making my
warriors like themselves, good at talking but no workers.
They drink the accursed fire-water and become hogs. In a
few years, the name of Sac will be forgotten and they will
be but beasts to carry the loads the white man puts upon
their backs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use talkin&rsquo; now, Black-Hawk,&rdquo; said Cooney Joe.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s right&mdash;because it ain&rsquo;t&mdash;for Keokuk had no
right to sell your land. But, the thing&rsquo;s done and our fellers
have possession, and I&rsquo;m afraid they won&rsquo;t give it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pshaw; you ought to know that they are darned
good at takin&rsquo; things but they don&rsquo;t give back wuth a cent.
You may as well build a village over yender.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That they may come and take it again,&rdquo; replied Black-Hawk,
with a bitter laugh. &ldquo;Let us speak no more, for
my tongue grows bitter in my mouth. Sons of the Sac, let
us go for corn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian stalked away, followed by a shouting crowd of
his adherents, and Cooney Joe looked uneasily at Wescott.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this, &rsquo;square. You see our fellers ar&rsquo; mighty
rough on the Injins, and I heard some on &rsquo;em say that ef the
Sacs came over to steal corn they&rsquo;d give &rsquo;em an all-fired lickin&rsquo;.
Now if they do that it means war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope our men will not be so impudent,&rdquo; said Wescott.
&ldquo;They ought to give the poor fellows a chance to carry away
corn for their suffering families, since they have dispossessed
them of their land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half an hour passed, when suddenly there came a great tumult
from the direction in which the Indians had gone. The
shouts of men, the loud and continuous barking of dogs, and
the occasional crack of fire-arms, could be heard.</p>
<p>Cooney Joe caught up his weapons, and followed by Mr.
Wescott, hurried away in the direction from which the sound
came. They had not gone half a mile when they came upon
a great rabble of whites surrounding the party which had
come over for corn, abusing them in every possible way.
Showers of stone were hurled upon them, clods of earth and
filth of every description was cast upon them, and they were
fighting their way slowly back toward the stream, apparently
unconscious of the insults heaped upon them. Foremost
among them, walking with a firm step, but with a dark cloud
gathering upon his brow, strode Black-Hawk. A stone had
struck him on the forehead, and the blood was trickling slowly
down his face, but he did not seem to be aware of the
fact. Once or twice he turned his head when some unusually
vile epithet was heaped upon him, with a haughty glance at
the offender, which they remembered in the after times, for
two men who struck him, and whom he marked for destruction,
were the first to fall when the struggle commenced in
earnest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;White men,&rdquo; cried the chief, halting, at length. &ldquo;Do
not dare to stand in the track of Black-Hawk, upon his own
land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your land, you old thief,&rdquo; roared a man named Churchill.
&ldquo;You lie! It is ours&mdash;fairly bought&mdash;and we will keep
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Black-Hawk does not waste words with a man with a
double tongue, who is only fit to sit with the women when
the warriors are on the battle-field,&rdquo; replied the chief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>Churchill caught up a handful of sand and flung it into
the face of the old chief. Black-Hawk trembled in every
limb but not with fear, and he clenched his hands until the
blood started from beneath his nails.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; he hissed. &ldquo;In the days to come, remember
Black-Hawk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That the man had good cause to remember this insult, the
history of that time will show.</p>
<p>The Indians went on their way, but all around them the
confusion became greater, and it was with the utmost difficulty
that they kept their ranks, and kept down their passions
enough to prevent the use of the tomahawks, which
every man carried. Had Black-Hawk but given the word,
they would have rushed like tigers upon their prey, and torn
the rabble asunder like cobweb. But the policy of the chief
had been opposed to bloodshed, and he hoped to be able to
get to the river without being forced to draw a weapon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at the black thieves,&rdquo; roared Churchill. &ldquo;Down
with them, boys; shower the mud on them; stone them out
of the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was but too well seconded by those who followed him,
and many of the Indians were badly hurt by the missiles
which were thrown at them. Directed by Churchill, three
or four strong men rushed suddenly forward and laid hold
upon the chief, with the intention of beating him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dogs!&rdquo; cried the Sac, casting them aside like feathers.
&ldquo;Take your clubs, sons of the brave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up to this moment the Indians had not lifted a hand, but
at the order of their chief they lifted their clubs, and sprung
forward with furious yells. The chief singled out Churchill,
and leaped upon him like a tiger, but the man ran backward,
and the chief, never thinking of support, followed him with
uplifted club. Before he was aware of his danger he was in
the midst of a circle of infuriated whites, who commenced
an indiscriminate assault upon him, striking and kicking him
with merciless force. It is impossible to say whether he
would have escaped with life, but at this moment the rabble
parted before the rush of strong men, and Cooney Joe and
Mr. Wescott darted into the circle, and placed themselves beside
the chief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;Back, if you are men,&rdquo; cried Wescott. &ldquo;What, thirty
against one poor old man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep cl&rsquo;ar, keep cl&rsquo;ar,&rdquo; cried Joe, flourishing his rifle in
a threatening manner. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s an Injin, but fair play&rsquo;s a
jewel, you know. You won&rsquo;t strike him ag&rsquo;in while I stand
hyar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out of the way, Joe Bent,&rdquo; screamed Churchill.
&ldquo;What business have you to interfere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m called on by a magistrate,&rdquo; replied Joe.
&ldquo;Keep cl&rsquo;ar, I tell ye, or I&rsquo;ll make my rifle-butt acquainted
with the softness of yer head. Back a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disperse, every one of you, and let the Indians return to
the river, and I will see to it that you are punished for what
you have already done,&rdquo; said Wescott, as they hesitated.
There was some grumbling, but after a little they began to
step away, and the little knot of Indians were left alone upon
the field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry that this has happened, Black-Hawk,&rdquo; said
Wescott. &ldquo;You want corn, you say; go to my crib and
take out what you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chief did not reply, but he stood looking after the retreating
forms of the white men, with a moody brow. Many
a man who was in his grave before that season closed, might
have been alive and happy but for that vile attack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Black-Hawk owes much to the white man,&rdquo; he said,
slowly. &ldquo;They have stolen his village, trampled upon his
father&rsquo;s grave, plowed up the earth above the dead, and
scored the earth with their axes. Now they have insulted
Black-Hawk and he will remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would not take it too much to heart, Black-Hawk,&rdquo;
said Wescott.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Black-Hawk will remember,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;But look
my brother. By this blood which drops upon the earth I
promise friendship to you and yours. You are two just
white men; and all the tribes shall honor you for what you
have done this night. Let my good brother go toward the
rising sun and stay until the tempest has passed by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wescott shook his head, and walked beside the chief to
the river. He refused to take any corn, and as the canoes
pulled off the two foresters looked at each other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is bad, Joe,&rdquo; said Wescott, &ldquo;but we must get to
work. Do you know where the General is now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s at Jefferson Barracks&mdash;that&rsquo;s whar he is,&rdquo; replied
Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he must be spoken to and at once. In the mean
time I will take a horse and see other officers and concert
measures for the public safety. The whole North-west is in
danger, for many will follow Black-Hawk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They hurried back to the cabin, and to his delight the
settler found Captain Melton there, who had returned unsuccessful
from the pursuit of Black Will and Dick Garrett.</p>
<p>The young officer was well known to both Mr. Wescott
and Cooney Joe, and was cordially greeted by both.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was this disturbance I heard just now, Mr. Wescott?&rdquo;
said Melton, as they shook hands. &ldquo;It sounded almost
like a battle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was very near one as it was,&rdquo; said Wescott. &ldquo;Our
people surrounded a party of Indians who came over for
corn, insulted them in every conceivable way, beat and threw
stones at them and injured Black-Hawk quite severely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t tell me that they have hurt Black-Hawk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and if I know any thing of the Indian he will resent
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is too bad, just when we hoped to settle the matter
peaceably. Let the people on the frontier look to it
now, for there is trouble ahead as sure as we live. Hi,
there, Stanley,&rdquo; he cried, addressing one of his men. &ldquo;Ride
to the Post and see the General. Tell him exactly what has
happened, word for word, and when you have done that,
go back by way of the island and tell the rest of the boys
to come up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think they will fight, captain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course they will, and we have a lot of dunderheads
who will do their best to force it on. With your permission,
Mr. Wescott, I will stay here to-night, if you will let
the men sleep in your barn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly; if the house were large enough they should
be welcome to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The command of Melton was an independent one, composed
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
principally of bordermen and scouts, selected for their
known valor and knowledge of the country. As usual in
such cases they were despised by the dandy regiments until
two or three rough bouts between the men had taught them
a lesson. They were very popular with the masses, however,
and in a bush fight, were capable of doing more work than
any body of men in the service.</p>
<p>Two or three couriers were dispatched in various directions,
and then the party camped outside, while the captain
entered the house, where he was received by Mrs. Wescott and
the daughter. The elder lady had just returned from a visit
down the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Charley Melton, my prince of borderers, the best
scout captain in the territories,&rdquo; said Wescott. &ldquo;Captain, my
daughter Sadie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I met Miss Wescott early in the evening when in chase
of a desperate gambler who had shot a man over a card-table.
And indeed we met twice in the village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you caught him, captain,&rdquo; said Wescott.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry to say I did not. How the fellow managed to
slip away I don&rsquo;t know, but when we got to the bend, all
trace of them was lost. He had a man in his company
whom I want to see, for I believe he is stirring up the Indians
against us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean Black Will Jackwood, I&rsquo;ll bet,&rdquo; said Joe
Bent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; what made you think that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cause I see the bloody cuss at Rock Island, whisperin&rsquo;
round old Black-Hawk, and it looked bad to me, somehow.
It will be a &rsquo;markably good thing when he is hung up out of
harm&rsquo;s way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That good thing will be very likely to happen if we have
the good luck to catch them. Ha! What Indian girl is
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Minneoba, the daughter of Black-Hawk,&rdquo; replied the girl,
coming forward. &ldquo;Let not Loud Tempest fear that she will
speak the words she hears in the lodge of her white father in
the ear of the Sacs. Minneoba is not a creeping serpent, and
will not betray her friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Loud Tempest, eh? Poetical name the Sacs have given
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
me, though for what cause I do not know. What have you
there, Dix?&rdquo;</p>
<p>An orderly had appeared at the door and saluted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caught a Pottawatomie, just now, who claims that he has
something to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little Fox.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pah! I don&rsquo;t think much can be made out of <i>him</i>. However,
bring him in, and let us hear what he has to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The orderly turned and beckoned, and an Indian, greasy
and smoke-begrimed, with a face which bore evident signs of
hard potations, appeared in the doorway. This &ldquo;lord of the
forest&rdquo; was very drunk. His eyes rolled in their sockets,
and he found it easiest to stand by the aid of the door-post.</p>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER IV.</span>
<br />LITTLE FOX&mdash;NA-SHE-ESCHUCK.</h2>
<p>The Indian was one of the worst specimens of his race&mdash;a
creature naturally brutal, who had been rendered more debased
by an excessive use of fire-water. As he clung to the
door-post and looked at them out of bleared and watery eyes,
he was as disgusting a specimen of the <i>genus homo</i> as could
be found between the two oceans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me talk to this critter,&rdquo; said Cooney Joe. &ldquo;I calculate
I understand the natur&rsquo; of the unadulterated, unb&rsquo;iled,
unwashed and unclean drunken red, as well as any man in the
great Nor&rsquo;-west. I do, by the livin&rsquo; hokies. Hyar, you &rsquo;possum,
speak up, and speak quick; what ar&rsquo; ye looking fur
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire-water; poor Injun <i>very</i> dry,&rdquo; replied this noble red-man.
&ldquo;Tire&mdash;much tire; walk durn good ways; <i>mus&rsquo;</i> hab
fire-water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got to airn it fust, my noble red,&rdquo; replied Joe.
&ldquo;Come, agitate yer jaw; tell us what ye want.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;pose you give Little Fox fire-water, den talk. How <i>can</i>
talk when no hab drink? Ugh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the heathen philosophy, gents all,&rdquo; said Joe, with
a look of supreme disgust. &ldquo;No whisky, no news. Got sech
a thing as a drain of sperrits handy, &rsquo;square?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Wescott left the room, and returned shortly with a
small flask of rum, from which he poured out a glass for the
Indian, who drank it with avidity, smacked his lips, and held
out the glass for more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; said Joe, pushing back the extended hand.
&ldquo;Not ef I know it, Injin. That tongue of yours begins to
double, anyhow, and I reckon you&rsquo;ll hev to do some talking
afore you git any more rum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pottawatomie big warrior, <i>much</i> brave,&rdquo; replied the Indian,
loftily, striking his clenched hand upon his broad breast.
&ldquo;Give Injun rum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a bat &rsquo;long side your old head ef ye ask fur
more afore you&rsquo;ve done the work,&rdquo; said Joe, angrily. &ldquo;Come
now, speak up. What d&rsquo;ye want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want rifle&mdash;want blanket&mdash;want <i>heap</i> fire-water!&rdquo; replied
Little Fox. &ldquo;Got heap story to tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lies, probably. Come, out with it, and ef it is any use
to us, then we&rsquo;ll pay han&rsquo;sum. That&rsquo;s the time of day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want him <i>now</i>,&rdquo; replied the Indian, with a surly glance
at the speaker. &ldquo;No tell news widout you put him down
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do, Injin,&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;You heard what the
fellers done with Black-Hawk, just now. I&rsquo;ve only got to say
the word, and you go away the <i>sorest</i> Injin in the Nor&rsquo;-west.
Tell us any really important news, and we&rsquo;ll give you
a rifle, two blankets and a keg of rum, and you kin drink
you&rsquo;self to death in a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much <i>promise</i>&mdash;little <i>do</i>. Dat white man&rsquo;s way,&rdquo; replied
the Indian. &ldquo;Little Fox no speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you speak if <i>I</i> promise to give you what you ask?&rdquo;
said Captain Melton, advancing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Loud Tempest will do what he says,&rdquo; replied the Indian,
with a drunken leer. &ldquo;Little Fox will believe him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then; I promise to give you the rifle, blankets
and rum, if you tell us all you came to tell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give Injun stool; sit down like white man. Floor much
dizzy; whirl round <i>fast</i>. Ugh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the not very mild assistance of Cooney Joe the Indian
was seated on a stool, with his back to the wall, and sat with
drunken gravity waiting to be questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on with yer story, you red nigger,&rdquo; cried Joe. &ldquo;And
see yer, the minnit you begin to <i>lie</i>&mdash;and oh, Lord, how he <i>kin</i>
lie when he lays his tongue to it!&mdash;that minnit I jump on
you and yer ha&rsquo;r comes off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little Fox will speak with a straight tongue,&rdquo; replied the
savage, drawing himself up. &ldquo;Give injun more rum, and
he talk <i>heap</i> fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cooney Joe poured out a very mild dose of rum and gave
it to the savage, who gulped it down at once, and would have
asked for more but that the expression of Joe&rsquo;s face taught
him that such a measure would bring down upon his head
the wrath of the hunter, and he prudently refrained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Black-Hawk much mad,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;See&mdash;white man
take his village and plant corn among the graves. That no
right in white man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No moril reflections, bummer,&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;Git on with
yer yarn, or off goes yer sculp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Black-Hawk has a great army,&rdquo; said the Indian. &ldquo;His
braves are coming in from the plains and their faces are
painted for war. The white men must not sleep or they will
all die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is needless to follow word by word the disjointed narrative
of the drunken savage, interrupted as it was by appeals
for rum, which was doled out to him in very small quantities
by Cooney Joe, who feared that he would get too drunk
to articulate. He sat swaying unsteadily to and fro, and
told a tale which confirmed their fears. Messengers had been
sent out to the various tribes, and all had agreed to follow
the standard of Black-Hawk and assist him in driving out
the invaders of their land. Nearly all the principal chiefs
except Keokuk had given in their adhesion, and bands of
warriors were already on their way to the place of rendezvous,
not far from Rock Island, where there was a Sac village
and a fort. Doubtless the Indian misrepresented the
plans of Black-Hawk, but he told enough truth to make his
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
story tally with the preconceived ideas of the whites, and
they looked at one another in silent dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is very serious,&rdquo; said the captain of scouts. &ldquo;This
Indian has earned his reward, and if he will come into the
village to-morrow he shall have the liquor; the rifle and
blankets I can give him now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went out and brought in a very good rifle and two
blankets, which he had obtained from the men. A flask of
powder was added, and a mold to run bullets, and Little Fox
staggered away, happy as a lord, little knowing that the possession
of these articles would prove his death-warrant.
With the weapon in his hands he staggered toward the village,
where he was met by a young warrior of the Sac nation,
whom, in his drunken blindness, he did not recognize
as the youngest son of Black-Hawk, who was lurking about
for information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother has a fine gun,&rdquo; he said in the Indian tongue,
endeavoring to lay his hand upon the weapon. But Little
Fox tore it away from him in drunken wrath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wagh! It is the gun of the white man, and the Sacs
will fall before it as the leaves when they are yellow,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother is very rich. He must have taken much fur
to buy so fine a gun,&rdquo; said the young Indian, who already
showed the qualities which afterward gave him a leading
place in the tribe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little Fox is the friend of the white man, and he can get
a gun for nothing,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;When Black-Hawk
comes with his warriors he will find the white men ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has my brother told the white men what Black-Hawk
is doing?&rdquo; said the young Sac, vailing his rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little Fox can speak or Little Fox can be silent,&rdquo; replied
the Pottawatomie. &ldquo;Look: to-morrow he is to have enough
rum to last him a whole moon, because he is the friend of
the white man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire-water is good,&rdquo; said the Sac. &ldquo;Has my brother a
canoe to carry it across the river?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian shook his head, and a sort of hazy idea passed
through his clouded brain that he had already said as much
as he ought concerning the affair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have a fine canoe,&rdquo; continued the son of Black-Hawk.
&ldquo;Let my brother bring the rum to the Point, and I will help
him carry it away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Pottawatomie nodded gravely, and went on his sinuous
way, while the young chief darted into the forest, and
taking a circuitous course, reached his father&rsquo;s village at
early morning. The old chief was in his lodge, in an attitude
of the deepest dejection, for he had not sought a quarrel
with the whites. Near him, seated upon a pile of skins,
and with a look of deep malice on his face, sat Black Will,
holding his rifle in his brown right hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! here comes Na-she-eschuck,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now,
Black-Hawk, let your great heart awake and listen to the
words of your son. Speak, Na-she-eschuck; what are the
white men doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They go about among the lodges they have built above
our fathers&rsquo; graves and laugh because they have insulted
Black-Hawk,&rdquo; replied the young Sac, fiercely. &ldquo;Their ears
are stopped to all thoughts of peace, and they long for war.
Let them get what they seek, since they will have it so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did I tell you, Black-Hawk?&rdquo; said Black Will.
&ldquo;The scoundrels do not care for your great name, and they
throw mud at you as if you were a common Pottawatomie,
and not the head chief of a great nation. Will you bear
this tamely?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Black-Hawk is an Indian,&rdquo; replied the proud old man,
drawing up his stalwart form to its full hight. &ldquo;But he does
not seek for war. If the white men will let us rest where
we now are, I will send the warriors back, and we will be
friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friends! Friends with the men who threw mud in your
face and beat you like a dog?&rdquo; cried Black Will. &ldquo;Come,
I have been mistaken in you. I thought you were a man
ready to revenge your injuries, but the white men have cowed
you until you dare not lift a hand against them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Black-Hawk bounded to his feet with a terrible cry, and
laid his hand upon a weapon. But that Na-she-eschuck
sprung between him and the object of his wrath, it is doubtful
whether the career of Black Will would not have ended
upon the spot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your hand, great chief,&rdquo; cried his son, forcing him
back. &ldquo;He sits under the shadow of your lodge, and you
have smoked the pipe with him. Do not make yourself a
dog since you have taken his hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has insulted a great chief,&rdquo; replied the old warrior,
fiercely. &ldquo;But, he is right; Black-Hawk is a dog to listen to
the words of the white men, and to refuse to dig up the
hatchet when so many warriors are ready to follow him to the
fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We <i>must</i> fight,&rdquo; said Na-she-eschuck. &ldquo;Little Fox has
been among the white men, and has told them that the braves
are gathering at the call of Black-Hawk. He is a dead dog,
and has taken a rifle and blankets, and is to have much fire-water,
because he has betrayed us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Black Will began to look uneasy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has the scoundrel told them that I am here?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can not tell. He is to come to the point above the island
with the price of his guilt, to-morrow, and I will be there
to help him over the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A grim look crossed the face of Black-Hawk, as his son
spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;One traitor shall die, because he
has sold himself for the fire-water of the white men. As for
us, we will not strike the first blow, but if they take up the
hatchet against us, then we will fight. But I will not remove.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is better for us to strike the first blow,&rdquo; said Black
Will. &ldquo;That is the main thing in war&mdash;to strike such a terrible
blow, that their hearts will turn water in their bosoms.
Look at me; I am of the blood of the white men, but I am
not <i>all</i> white. A chief of the Sacs was my father, and he
is dead. He died in chains, because he dug up the hatchet
against the cowardly Chippewas. You have known and
loved him, for you fought by his side. Black-Hawk, Red-Bird
was the father of the man who speaks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; cried the chief. &ldquo;Red-Bird was a man, but he
could not bear the chains of the white man, and he died. Is
my son the child whom he lost, who was born of the French
squaw, who followed him from Detroit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Black Will inclined his head slowly, and Black-Hawk took
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
his hand in his own and pressed it again and again to his bosom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Black-Hawk can understand how the son of Red-Bird
should hate the white man,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We will fight side by
side in this war, and if we die, let us die bravely. Are the
warriors coming in, Na-she-eschuck?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are gathering from every side. They have heard
of the insult to Black-Hawk, and their hearts are hot in their
bosoms. They will behave like men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; said the chief. &ldquo;Now we will go forth,
and you shall see how Black-Hawk shall give a traitor his
dues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They left the lodge, and followed by the brother of Black-Hawk,
and Napope, a celebrated chief, moved down toward
the river, where the rest of the party concealed themselves
while Na-she-eschuck brought out his canoe and crossed to
the other shore.</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER V.</span>
<br />THE PRICE OF TREACHERY.</h2>
<p>Little Fox had remained all night in the white village,
and as it was noised about that he had betrayed the plans of
Black-Hawk, he had no lack of his favorite beverage, and
morning found him as drunk as ever. Captain Melton sent
a man with a canoe to carry the price of the information to
the point above the island, and as the son of Black-Hawk was
crossing the river, Little Fox was sitting in drunken state
upon his keg, dreaming of the glorious times he would have
when he broached it in the seclusion of his lodge. He remembered
indistinctly that some one had promised to help
him across the river with his prize, but for his life could not
remember who it was, and it almost sobered him when he
saw Na-she-eschuck crossing from the other shore, and he
fumbled with the lock of his rifle, and was half inclined to
warn the Sac to keep off. But the fumes of the liquor were
still in his brain, and the young chief landed and came toward
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Pottawatomie did not lie to Na-she-eschuck,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;Let us put the fire-water into the canoe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You put him in,&rdquo; said the owner. &ldquo;Me watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked on while Na-she-eschuck placed the keg in the
canoe and then followed, and, drunk as he was, managed to
seat himself safely in the light craft. The Sac followed, and
obeying the orders he had received, headed up the river,
rounded the point of the island, and made toward the other
shore. There was something in the stern, steadfast look of
Na-she-eschuck which struck a chill into the heart of the traitor
Pottawatomie, and almost sobered him, and twice he laid
his hand upon his rifle, as if tempted to use it upon his companion.
But, as often as he did so, the countenance of the
Sac took on a pleasant air of good fellowship, which made
it impossible to be angry with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why does not Na-she-eschuck go to the bank?&rdquo; said
Little Fox. &ldquo;We will make a hole in the fire-water tub and
drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The canoe was now headed directly for the point of the
woodland which came down to the water&rsquo;s edge, and after
drawing the light bark up the bank, they took the keg between
them and carried it up to the first opening, where it
was placed upon its end, while Little Fox, by the aid of his
knife, succeeded in drawing out the bung.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wagh!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Smell good, don&rsquo;t he, Na-she-eschuck?
Now s&rsquo;pose you get straws, we drink much, good
deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sac went down to the water&rsquo;s edge and quickly cut
two long, slender reeds, one of which he gave to Little Fox,
and the two sat down over the keg, inserted the reeds, and
began to imbibe after the manner of boys over a barrel of
cider. But, although Na-she-eschuck went through all the
motions of drinking rapidly, it is doubtful if he took as much
as Little Fox, whose fiery eyes began to light up as he took
in the burning fluid, and in five minutes he was more drunk
than before he crossed the stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;E-yah! Little Fox is the friend of the white man. Who
would not serve them when he can earn such drink?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell Na-she-eschuck what to do and he will get fire-water
from the white man.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>Drunk as he was, Little Fox looked at the speaker in astonishment.
That the Sac youth would betray his father
seemed impossible to him, and yet knowing how strong his
own love of liquor was, and that he would betray a nation
to obtain it, his surprise faded away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will Na-she-eschuck do this? He can get more fire-water
than Little Fox, for he knows more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What must I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to the white men and tell them all that Black-Hawk
is doing, and my brother will be very rich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has Little Fox done this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has done what he could, but he did not know much,&rdquo;
replied the traitor. &ldquo;Na-she-eschuck has been in the lodge
of his father and heard his words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Na-she-eschuck will do any thing for fire-water,&rdquo; said
the young chief, seeming to reel as he sat. &ldquo;Did the white
men give all this for the message which was brought them
by Little Fox?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Pottawattomie nodded, and again applied his mouth to
the reed. But, at this moment the expression of drunken
gravity passed away from the face of Na-she-eschuck. He
bounded to his feet, with a look of wild rage upon his dark
face and his hand upon his hatchet, and drunk as Little Fox
was, he could see that he was deceived and that Na-she-eschuck
was perfectly sober. He would have seized his
rifle, but the foot of the young Sac was firmly planted upon
it and he found it impossible to raise it, and the threatening
action of Na-she-eschuck caused him to draw back in
alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dog&mdash;traitor!&rdquo; hissed the chief. &ldquo;You have betrayed
our people into the hands of the enemy and you shall die.
Black-Hawk, Napope and Wa-be-ke-zhick, appear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, the three chiefs, accompanied by Will Jackwood,
appeared from the bushes upon the right. Every
face was black with fury, and the traitorous savage knew
that his doom was fast approaching. He would have fled,
but the strong hands of Na-she-eschuck and Napope were
upon him, and in the twinkling of an eye his hands were
bound behind him and Black-Hawk stood regarding him with
a steadfast look, which had no pity in it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;The ears of Black-Hawk have heard the words which
have been spoken by the mouth of a traitor. Away with
him to the sacred wood and then call the warriors to witness
his fate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Napope and Na-she-eschuck dragged him away, and Black-Hawk
uttered a signal whoop which quickly brought four
stalwart Indians to the spot, who, at the command of Black-Hawk,
fastened up the keg, and making a sort of cradle of
strong boughs, carried the liquor away toward the sacred
forest, being solemnly warned not to touch it on their lives.
After them marched the remaining chiefs and Black-Hawk,
taking a sequestered path through the wood. Half an hour&rsquo;s
walk brought them to a deep glen in the midst of the solemn
woods, where a sort of rude altar was erected, and where the
mystic ceremonies of their strange religion were nearly always
observed. A solitary tree of small size, with a blackened
trunk, the scene of many a sacrifice, was standing in
the center of the glade, and there, tightly bound with green
withes, stood Little Fox awaiting his fate.</p>
<p>The Indian was sober enough now, for nothing brings a
man to his senses so quickly, no matter how much stupefied
by drink, as the presence of danger. His eyes roved from
face to face for some sign of relenting or pity, but he found
none.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why has Black-Hawk brought a Pottawattomie here?&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;He dare not shed the blood of the son of Na-bo-lish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Na-bo-lish was a great chief but his son is a dog,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Black-Hawk will not shed his blood, and a coward&rsquo;s
death he shall die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little Fox knows how to die, if die he must,&rdquo; replied
the Indian, proudly. &ldquo;He will speak no more and he dares
Black-Hawk to do his worst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The summons had gone forth, and one by one the chiefs
and warriors began to enter the sacred wood. Every face
was clouded, for they knew that they would not have been
called to this place but to witness some great sacrifice. A
single glance at the prisoner was all they gave, and then, man
by man, they seated themselves in a great circle and waited
for the coming of others. In less than an hour from the time
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
when Little Fox was taken, five hundred grim warriors were
seated within the glade, and then Black-Hawk arose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chiefs and warriors,&rdquo; he cried&mdash;&ldquo;children of the same
great Father, although our tribes are many&mdash;listen to Black-Hawk.
He is getting old, his hair is gray, but he weeps for
the sorrows of the poor Indian. Once, all these great hunting-grounds,
in which the white man plants his corn, were the
property of the Indian. There he lived&mdash;there he died, and
there he lies buried. The steel of the white man&rsquo;s plow is
among the bones, and he builds his lodge in the villages which
once were ours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This should make an Indian very sad, and he should do
all he can to help his people. But there are some who are
so base that for the fire-water of the white man they would
sell their fathers&rsquo; bones. It grieves the heart of Black-Hawk
that this should be so, for he loves the Indian. Now, when
we have risen for our rights, and to protect our once happy
homes, Indians of the pure blood stand ready to give us up a
prey to the white man, that they may drink the strong water
which makes men mad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look upon this man. He is a son of the great Na-bo-lish,
the Pottawattomie. Once, he was a man and a mighty
warrior. His foot was quick upon the war-path, and his hand
ready to shed the blood of his enemies. The white men came
and brought the strong water to the villages. Little Fox was
no longer a man when he had taken it into his mouth. Let
Na-she-eschuck speak, and tell the warriors what Little Fox
has done, and then let them speak. I have done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat down amid a strange murmuring, and Na-she-eschuck
arose. The young chief was well known for his strict honesty,
and they were assured that he would not lie to save his
life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father has spoken good words. Little Fox has sold
us to the white men for a rifle, two blankets and this fire-water,&rdquo;
striking the keg with his foot. &ldquo;Out of his own
mouth condemn him. Let him die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Napope arose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard the words which came from the lips of Little
Fox, and the Sac has spoken the truth. Let Little Fox die
like a dog.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I heard it,&rdquo; cried the Prophet. &ldquo;I&mdash;Wa-be-ke-zhick,
the Prophet. He sold us to the white men and he deserves
to die. Now let the chiefs and warriors speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a sudden movement among the listening warriors.
They arose as one man, and every voice pealed out
the solemn sentence: &ldquo;He is a traitor; let him die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are women,&rdquo; shrieked the Pottawottamie, fiercely.
&ldquo;Do your worst; Little Fox will show you how to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; said Black-Hawk, slightly inclining his head.
&ldquo;We will not deny that Little Fox has been a great brave,
but he is now a dog. Let the chiefs come about me, and we
will have a talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were not long in consultation, and then separated,
the chiefs going about among the men and giving their orders.
Then a long-sounding whoop from Black-Hawk called
them into line, and they began to circle about the tree, pointing
their fingers scornfully at the prisoner. Then Black-Hawk
advanced and bared the breast of the prisoner, exposing the
totem of his tribe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;he bears upon his bosom the sign of a
great tribe. This is not well, and it must be removed. Wa-be-ke-zhick,
advance, and cut the totem from his flesh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut away the totem of the great tribe,&rdquo; cried the warriors.
&ldquo;He has no right to wear it, who is a dog. Cut it
away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The countenance of Little Fox was distorted with rage
more than fear. Drunken and worthless as he had become,
he was a true Indian, and felt keenly the disgrace about to
be put upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not dare to make a chief a dog,&rdquo; he hissed. &ldquo;Give
me the torture, or give me death. Have I no friend among
this people who will strike a sharp knife into my breast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he a friend among the warriors who will do this?&rdquo;
said Black-Hawk. &ldquo;Let him speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No voice replied, and the countenance of Little Fox changed
from hope to fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has no friend,&rdquo; cried Black-Hawk. &ldquo;Advance, Wa-be-ke-zhick;
cut away the totem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was done, and Little Fox, if he lived, was ostracised for
ever from his tribe and death would be to him a happy release.
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
In the mean time, a great caldron had been placed
upon a fire, and in this the keg of rum was poured, and a
great quantity of gourds piled up beside it. The spirits had
now begun to bubble, and taking up a little in a gourd,
Black-Hawk advanced and offered it to the condemned man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For this you sold us to the white men, Little Fox.
Drink, now that I give it to you. It is warm&mdash;it is good&mdash;it
will make you strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, he dashed the contents of the gourd against
the breast of the doomed man, and Little Fox uttered an appalling
shriek which rung with startling distinctness through
the forest. Now ensued a horrible scene, as Indian after Indian
caught up a gourd and dashed a portion of the boiling
spirits upon the naked body of the traitor. Black Will
stopped his ears and turned away his head to shut out the
agonizing sights and sounds which the sacrifice presented.
He was a cruel man by nature, but he found that the Indians
could go beyond him in refinement of torture. At last the
caldron was empty, and the victim stood literally parboiled
at the stake, gnawing his lips to keep down the shrieks which
arose in spite of himself. The faces of his stern executioners
did not change, and they were about to commence some new
species of torture, when Black Will sprung between.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, Black-Hawk; stand back there, Napope. This fellow
deserves death. But you shall not torture him any longer.
Kill him, and put him out of pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand aside, white man!&rdquo; cried Napope. &ldquo;Why do you
come between the warriors and a traitor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;White man! I am the son of Red-Bird, the Sac, who died
in the white man&rsquo;s prison; and I say that this shall not go
on. Will you kill him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; let the torture go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Black Will wheeled in his tracks, drew a pistol, and shot
Little Fox through the heart. Bloody as the deed was, it
was mercy, compared with the torture in store for the traitor.
He started as the bullet pierced him, a look of ferocious joy
passed over his face, and his head dropped upon his bosom.
There came a wild rush at the immovable figure of Black
Will, but the sonorous voice of Black-Hawk was heard, ordering
them to stand back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;Touch not the son of Red-Bird, lest you make an enemy
of Black-Hawk,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Take down the body and cast
it out in the open woods, that the wolves may eat all that is
left of a traitor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The work was done, and although there was some grumbling
at being robbed of their victim so early, the bravest
among the warriors were inclined to commend the bold action
of Black Will, although, under the circumstances, none
of them would have dared to do the same. The body was
thrown upon the earth to rot, and the warriors on their march
back to the village, when a runner, hot with haste, dashed
into the forest and met Black-Hawk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the braves take their hatchets,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;The
white men are upon the march.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha,&rdquo; cried Black-Hawk. &ldquo;Do they come with arms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Major Stillman comes, with many warriors,&rdquo; replied the
runner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us see if they are friends,&rdquo; said Black-Hawk. &ldquo;If
they come in peace it is well. If they harm a hair of one
of my young men they shall all die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sent out five young warriors with a white flag, who did
not return. Later in the day three more went out and reconnoitered
in the vicinity of the advance of the white men.
They were pursued and two of them killed, the first blood
shed in the war. The third escaped and brought the news
to Black-Hawk, and they dug up the hatchet and prepared
for war.</p>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER VI.</span>
<br />THE FIRST BLOW.</h2>
<p>It must be admitted by unprejudiced men and thinkers of
all lands, that the &ldquo;Black-Hawk&rdquo; war was precipitated by
the rapacity of the whites. Not satisfied with driving the
Indians from the better portion of their lands, they persisted
still further in forcing them from their villages about Rock
Island. They would have been less than men if they had not
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
resisted, but to the last, Black-Hawk insisted that he would not
be the first to shed blood, and, as we have seen, the first man
killed was one of Black-Hawk&rsquo;s band, by Stillman&rsquo;s party.</p>
<p>This man seemed to have little knowledge of the Indian
character, and lacked the power of leading men. He had
been sent out by General Atkinson in advance, with orders to
scour the country, find out the position of the Indian force,
and to act as his discretion seemed to dictate. Captain Melton
was with him, and had occasion twice to remonstrate
with him upon his manner of advancing through a country
favorable to an ambuscade. The troop consisted of two
hundred and seventy mounted men, marching without order,
straggling where they liked, and firing at any stray Indian
of whatever tribe, whom they chanced to meet.</p>
<p>When the flag of Black-Hawk appeared, Stillman ordered
the bearers to be taken prisoners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, Major Stillman,&rdquo; said Melton, as he heard the
order. &ldquo;Surely you do not propose to make these men prisoners?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly I do, sir; take your place and let me hear no
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your words will require an explanation at another time
and place, my good sir,&rdquo; said Melton. &ldquo;Be so good as to remember
that I had no orders to join you, and that if you insist
upon such conduct, I will leave you at once. These men
came to you under the shadow of a white flag, and you have
no right to take them prisoners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Will</i> you take your place, Captain Melton?&rdquo; roared Stillman,
&ldquo;or must I put you under arrest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Melton said no more, but fell back to the head of his troop,
fully determined to leave the irate major if he persisted in
his conduct.</p>
<p>The three bearers of the flag were sent to the rear, under
guard, and the troop proceeded in the same disorderly manner.
Some time after the stragglers in advance caught sight
of the warriors who had been sent out to see what had been
done with the bearers of the flag, and were pursued, and two
of them shot down without mercy, the rest escaping, by taking
to the woods in front. No sooner had he beheld this
cruel and uncalled for butchery, than the young captain of
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
scouts called to his men and they wheeled out of the line,
faced about, and marched back toward the river.</p>
<p>Stillman, boiling with rage, called his men to a halt, and
rode back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this conduct, Captain Melton?&rdquo;
he hissed, fairly foaming at the mouth. &ldquo;How dare you detach
your command without orders?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you think you have men enough in your rag-tag and
bob-tail command to stop us, you had better try it on, Major
Stillman,&rdquo; said Melton, coolly. &ldquo;I for one will not give
countenance to <i>murder</i>, as you are doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murder, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murder is the word. Those Sacs were doing no harm
who were just killed by your men, and did not even use
their weapons when your scoundrels took after them. Go
on your way, sir; I will not march a foot further with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will have you court-martialed, upon my return, sir,&rdquo;
cried Stillman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well; I shall take an opportunity to tell the court
some things not to your credit. Good-day, sir. But, for
the safety of your men I tell you to call in your stragglers,
march in a more orderly manner and beat the bushes thoroughly
before you enter. Attention, scouts; forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the compact little body rode away at a killing pace,
leaving Major Stillman to his own devices.</p>
<p>Stillman hesitated for some time before advancing, for he
knew that the desertion of Captain Melton was a great loss
to him. While he stood in doubt, the men who had killed
two Indians came back at a gallop and announced that the
Indians were just across Sycamore creek and in some force.
All was now confusion in the white camp. Some who had
dismounted sprung into the saddle, and with wild shouts
the disorderly band rushed on, headed by the men who had
just come in. Black-Hawk had not supposed that Stillman
intended to attack him, and the greater portion of his
force were on the other side of the village; in all, the great
chief had only forty men under his command when Stillman&rsquo;s
men came up at the gallop, strung out across the
plain, man, by man, according to the speed of their horses,
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
and in this manner crossed the creek. Black-Hawk had
not hoped that they would thus give themselves a prey to
him, and his ambuscade was quickly formed.</p>
<p>When half the party had crossed the creek and were
massed in disorder upon the bank and the rest were struggling
up, some crossing the creek, and others yet upon the
plain beyond, the war-whoop of the Sacs announced the onset,
and from every side the warriors poured in upon the
foe. One withering volley was poured in, which strewed the
earth with dead and dying forms, and at the same moment
the charge was made and the knife and hatchet was doing
its silent but deadly work before the doomed men had time
to lift a hand. To show the utter foolishness with which
the advance was made, it is enough to say that the warlike
major was never in the fight at all, so quickly was the force
which had crossed the creek disposed of by the furious attack
of Black-Hawk.</p>
<p>The cry was, &ldquo;Satan take the hindmost.&rdquo; Hardly waiting
for Stillman&rsquo;s order to retreat, they broke and fled in
every direction, each man for himself, lashing their horses to
get out of the fearful imbroglio into which their own foolhardy
conduct had forced them.</p>
<p>Thus, in one desperate charge forty Indians had put two
hundred and seventy white men to flight! It is no discredit
to the West, for the men of Stillman&rsquo;s force, under a
different leader, would have laughed at the efforts of the Sac
force. They came into Dixon&rsquo;s Ferry as they had left Sycamore
creek, one at a time, and the loss gradually dwindled from
seventy to about one-fourth of the number.</p>
<p>The alarm went forth through the land, and the little
force of Sac warriors were magnified into an army. The
work had been done, however, and a scene of blood and
death was about to be enacted upon the border.</p>
<p>Captain Melton rode back to the settlement, after leaving
Stillman, but had not gone far when the flying men from
the band of heroes began to come up with him. Seeing
that the war was begun in earnest he faced about and prepared
to meet them as best he might, knowing nothing of
the small force of Black-Hawk. After waiting all night
for some sign of Indian pursuit, as none was made he drew
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
off his men and reached the settlement some hours after the
arrival of Stillman, who had been filling the ears of the inhabitants
with stories of the cowardly conduct of the captain.</p>
<p>The captain quickly set matters right, and only that he had
more important business upon his hands, would have followed
Stillman to the camp of Atkinson, to which he had directed
his steps. Taking ten of his men, he rode up the river, to
the residence of Mr. Wescott, but as he drew near, he found
evidences upon every hand of the presence of the destroyer,
and as he crossed the hill, saw, to his horror, that during the
last night the cabin had been attacked. Wild with fear, he
rushed in at the broken door and found every thing in confusion,
and scattered here and there, various bits of Indian
finery, beads and the like, which told him beyond a doubt
who had done the work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indians,&rdquo; said one of the men. &ldquo;Good heaven, captain,
they are killed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They explored the house everywhere, but not a trace of
the family could be seen. Upon the floor near the entrance
was a little pool of fresh blood, which looked as if it had
been shed the night before, and Melton looked at it with a
shudder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;Who has done this
ruin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is always so in an Indian war,&rdquo; said his lieutenant.
&ldquo;Some band of Indians coming up to join Black-Hawk, have
rushed in on them, before they had time to fire a shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody has been hurt,&rdquo; said Melton. &ldquo;Ha! what
have you got there, Chris?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the men came forward, holding in his hand a heavy
knife, with about three inches broken from the point. Upon
the hilt of the weapon, rudely engraved, was the name, &ldquo;R.
Garrett.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick Garrett has been here, then,&rdquo; said Melton, turning
pale; &ldquo;and if he has taken Sadie Wescott, it is done for
Black Will. Oh! heaven, what shall we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; said a feeble voice from beneath their feet.
&ldquo;Help me out of this and I&rsquo;ll let ye know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some one is in the cellar,&rdquo; said Melton. &ldquo;Up with the
trap and let him out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>The trap-door was opened, and Cooney Joe, bleeding and
ghastly, appeared at the foot of the ladder. A dozen hands
were extended to help him up, and he was seated upon one
of the stools, gasping for breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this, Joe?&rdquo; said Melton. &ldquo;Speak, man; don&rsquo;t
you see that I am in torture until I know the worst?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The worst is, that a party of red niggers, headed by Dick
Garrett, made a rush at us last night, and took Mr. Wescott
and the gal prisoners. I had a tussle with Dick Garrett, and
one of them cussid reds hit me over the head with a hatchet,
and I fell into the cellar. I do&rsquo;no&rsquo; what drove &rsquo;em off, but
they did not come down to raise my wool, and I&rsquo;ve been too
weak to git out without help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know which way they went?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I tell ye they knocked the life clean out of me,
the fust crack? I didn&rsquo;t fairly git my senses back till I
heerd ye talking. &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t above two hours sence they left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many had Dick Garrett under him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe twenty, the ugliest-lookin&rsquo; lot of whites painted
red you ever sot yer livin&rsquo; eyes on. I&rsquo;ll be bu&rsquo;sted ef they
wouldn&rsquo;t spile a lookin&rsquo;-glass by jest peekin&rsquo; into it; darned
lot of ruffi&rsquo;ns!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must follow them,&rdquo; hissed Melton, through his set
teeth. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have the girl out of their hands, if I have to
follow them into Black-Hawk&rsquo;s village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here; Black-Hawk do&rsquo;no&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout it. The pizen
cusses took his darter with &rsquo;em, but she sp&rsquo;iled one chap,
sure as you live. He got an arrer clean through him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is a brave girl, Joe. Oh, how sorry I am that you
are hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold hard; you ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; without me, you know. One
of your chaps wash out this cut, and put some plaster on it,
and we&rsquo;ll make it do. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo;, you bet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear you are not strong enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You be grannied! You see I&rsquo;ve got a sort of snickering
notion after that there Injin gal, and I&rsquo;ll be blowed if I don&rsquo;t
help her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his border life Melton had picked up a slight knowledge
of surgery, and he washed and dressed the wound as well as
the limited conveniences at his disposal would admit. Having
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
done so, Cooney Joe rose up, though somewhat &ldquo;weak
and staggering,&rdquo; to use his own expression, and was ready to
&ldquo;fight or run,&rdquo; as circumstances might require.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now see here, cripples,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That carroty-headed
son of a gun, Dick Garrett, is a whole boss-team, you bet ye.
He&rsquo;ll fight&mdash;he will&mdash;till the teeth meet in the flesh. Oh, you
bet he is on it, now. He kin shoot, and when we foller
him, we ain&rsquo;t tracking Sacs, so look out for thunder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he is in league with Black Will, and that scoundrel
has a hundred ruffians at his beck and call,&rdquo; said Melton.
&ldquo;We never should have had any trouble with the Indians but
for men of his kidney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now fur trailing,&rdquo; said Cooney Joe. &ldquo;Stand one side,
you critters, and let the old man work! I&rsquo;ve got a mark
that can&rsquo;t be beat, fur Dick wears the biggest moccasin of
any man in the Nor&rsquo;-west. Look around mighty spry, and
when you find a track like a young canoe, that&rsquo;s Dick Garrett&rsquo;s
hoof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trail was quickly found, and led to the northward.
They followed it swiftly, Cooney Joe bending slightly in the
saddle, and keeping his eyes on the trail, while the rest followed,
keeping far enough behind not to disturb the trail.
After a march of nearly two miles, the track suddenly ended
upon the bank of the Father of Waters, and they knew that
the scoundrels had taken to the stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now ain&rsquo;t this cussid mean; ain&rsquo;t it enuff to make a man
raise his hand against his venerable ancestor?&rdquo; roared Joe.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve took water, they hev. Here; send back two men
with the hosses, fur we&rsquo;ve got to hoof it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This plan was adopted, and two of the men returned with
the horses, while the rest searched about among the reeds,
and after some trouble found two rude dug-outs concealed, in
which, by making two trips, they crossed the great stream.
Here they scattered and searched up and down for the trail
which they had lost, still guided by the ponderous hoof of
Dick Garrett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>ain&rsquo;t</i> he pizen, that Dick!&rdquo; growled Cooney Joe. &ldquo;Its
just his nat&rsquo;ral cussedness, you know. He&rsquo;s aweer that I like
to ride, and he jest done this to be mean. Comes nat&rsquo;ral to
him, meanness does. Here you are; come on, boys!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>He had taken up the recovered trail as if no interruption
had occurred, and the party moved on across the plain.
They were tried men, who had followed Captain Melton in
many an hour of danger, but even their hearts gave a great
leap as they plunged into the Indian country, perhaps never
to return.</p>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER VII.</span>
<br />OVERBOARD.</h2>
<p>The surprise of the occupants of the log-cabin by the
river was sudden and complete, when at a late hour the
house was surrounded by a motley group headed by a man
who, in spite of his paint and feathers, could not hide from
so acute a scout as Samuel Wescott that he was a white man
in disguise. The rush was so sudden that they had been
overthrown before they had fairly time to reach their weapons,
and the captured men were at once hurried to their
horses, and the band made off at a rapid rate up the stream.
Mr. Wescott was wounded, but in spite of that the savage
white leader urged him on, threatening him with the point of
his knife if he faltered or turned aside. They reached the
river, when, to the surprise of all, a flat-boat shot out from
the western bank and made toward the eastern shore. The
men who held the poles were either white men or showed a
marvelous aptitude for flat-boating, an accomplishment rarely
to be looked for in an Indian who is not in love with manual
labor. The bow of the flat grated on the low beach, when
the party went on board, horses and all, and they pushed out
into the stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This boat belonged to Captain Hughes&rsquo; father,&rdquo; whispered
Sadie. &ldquo;Is it possible that these wretches have murdered
him and his crew?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ought to have come down some days ago,&rdquo; said
Mr. Wescott, in an uneasy tone. &ldquo;I am afraid that the good
old man has indeed fallen. Be careful what you say, for
these scoundrels understand every word you speak.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>At this moment the chief approached and caught Mr.
Wescott by his wounded arm, causing him to utter a low cry
of pain, while the blood gushed from under his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No whispering,&rdquo; he hissed, dropping all at once his assumed
Indian habits. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no baby, Sam Wescott, but a bird
of the woods, a Mississippi roarer, and I can lick the universal
earth a-flying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick Garrett!&rdquo; cried Wescott, in a tone of surprise. &ldquo;I
thought so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know me, do ye?&rdquo; said Dick, with an air of bravado.
&ldquo;All right, &rsquo;square, it&rsquo;s all the wuss for you, for Dick
Garrett don&rsquo;t let no man live that knows he wears an Injin
rig. Git ropes hyar and take a couple of hitches on this
chap, some of you fellers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you intend to do?&rdquo; cried Wescott, struggling.
&ldquo;Hands off, you scoundrels!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tie him tight, boys,&rdquo; replied Dick Garrett, in fiendish
glee. &ldquo;Teach the cuss to be so sharp, I will, before I git
done with him. Now, then, Sam Wescott, if you&rsquo;ve got any
prayers to say, say &rsquo;em quick, for overboard you go when we
get to that snag in the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot mean it,&rdquo; said Wescott. &ldquo;Such a cold blooded
and unprovoked murder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, give us a rest or I&rsquo;ll gag you,&rdquo; replied Dick Garrett.
&ldquo;The matter of a man more or less in the world ain&rsquo;t going
to shake it to its center, you bet, and when I say you&rsquo;ve got
to go under, then you go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have your way, then, murderous wretch,&rdquo; cried the brave
man, drawing himself up proudly. &ldquo;I will not beg for my
life from such as you, and am ready to die, if my time has
come, as bravely as another. Do your worst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sadie by this time began to comprehend the danger in
which her father stood, and would have come to him, but
she was forced back by one of the rough men who wore the
Indian garb, but who could not conceal a certain flat-boat
swagger which betrayed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He crows loud, boys, don&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; said Garrett; &ldquo;mighty
loud for a bird of his feather that&rsquo;s only got three minnits
to live. Keep the gal away; she ain&rsquo;t got leave to
die yet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go to my father,&rdquo; pleaded Sadie. &ldquo;Oh, sir, you
will not kill him for a single hasty word?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rather think I shall,&rdquo; replied Garrett, as cool and composed
as if talking of any ordinary event. &ldquo;The man&rsquo;s got
to go. I don&rsquo;t advertise to be a saint, and when a man runs
ag&rsquo;inst me and calls me a murderer, I reckon it&rsquo;s about time
for him to pass in his chips. I&rsquo;m a peaceable man&mdash;I will
<i>have</i> peace, or a fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This strange man was dreadfully in earnest. Human life
was to him a thing of no price&mdash;we might lose it to-day or
to-morrow, of we might live a hundred years&mdash;a small matter,
not to be taken into account. He had no objections to
killing a man, and if he had stood in his way, in any manner,
it became a <i>duty</i> to put him aside.</p>
<p>They were approaching the snag, and the desperado was
about to order the prisoner to be thrown into the water,
when the boatmen were suddenly thrust aside, and Minneoba,
holding her bow in her hand, darted forward and leveled an
arrow at his breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, white man,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;Minneoba is the daughter
of Black-Hawk, and she can not lie; if you do harm to the
good white man, I will send an arrow through your heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you cat!&rdquo; hissed Dick Garrett, turning upon her
with a devilish look. &ldquo;Stand out of the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Minneoba would not obey him. It was the second
time she had found her arrow effective, and it had some influence
upon the man who &ldquo;would have peace or a fight.&rdquo;
Although full of mad hate, he knew that she could aim an
arrow well, for he had seen her skill tested in the Indian
towns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the devil&rsquo;s name made me bring this cat on
board?&rdquo; he uttered. &ldquo;Better far have left her behind to find
her way to the village as best she could. Look you, Minneoba,&rdquo;
he added aloud. &ldquo;You know that I would not willingly
do you a wrong, but you must get out of the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Minneoba, stamping her foot. &ldquo;Minneoba
will not move, and if Garrett does wrong to the good white
man, he shall die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, my girl, be careful, please; I&rsquo;ll have to take measures
you won&rsquo;t like if you don&rsquo;t get out of the way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;Minneoba will shoot,&rdquo; replied the girl, with flashing eyes,
still pointing the arrow at his breast. Garrett nodded to
one of his men, and while the leader expostulated with her
he stole behind and suddenly caught her by the arm in a
firm clasp. With a cry of anger the girl caught the arrow
in her disengaged hand and drove it through the arm of her
captor, who released her with an oath, but before she could
strike again, Garrett had her in his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, lads!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hold this beauty fast,
and if she struggles I&rsquo;ll take toll from her lips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cease to struggle, Minneoba,&rdquo; said Mr. Wescott. &ldquo;You
only expose yourself to new indignity without the chance of
aiding me. I am ready to meet my fate, although it is a
hard one, but it grieves me to think that I die by the hands
of white men. Sadie, farewell&mdash;farewell, my dear child.
All that I have is yours and your dear mother&rsquo;s. Thank
God that she at least was absent when this blow fell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can not see you die,&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;Oh, Richard Garrett,
will nothing move you to do right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That depends on what you call <i>right</i>. Now you don&rsquo;t
think it right to beat a man at the picturs or billiards or to
pick his pocket, or crack a bank. Now I do, so we won&rsquo;t
seem to agree, no matter how you fix it, so I guess we may as
well end this now. Toss him over, boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It don&rsquo;t seem scarcely right,&rdquo; said the rough young fellow
who was helping Sadie back. &ldquo;Why not duck him, and
then let him out, boss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he knows I wear an Injin disguise. It&rsquo;s all
very well for you that he don&rsquo;t know, but I ain&rsquo;t so easy
suited. Toss him over, I say, and make no words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They lifted the bound man and flung him over the rail,
while with a thrilling shriek Sadie fell senseless into the
arms of the man who held her. He laid her gently down,
and made a spring at the taffrail, and his body struck the
water almost as soon as that of Mr. Wescott, who was unable
to help himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back here, you born fool,&rdquo; screamed Dick Garrett.
&ldquo;What do you think the Cap will say when he hears how
you act?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go to &mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; said the rough but good-hearted
fellow,
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
naming a locality not sought after by humanity generally.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to save this man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then by &mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; hissed Dick Garrett, &ldquo;you stay with him;
set in your poles, boys. Tom don&rsquo;t want to come on
board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time the man had seized the helpless form of
Wescott, and with his clasp-knife managed to cut the bonds
upon his hands and feet, and Wescott at once began to swim,
but feebly at first, and the fiendish order of the desperate
leader rung in his ears, and they saw the boat moving slowly
away, leaving them alone on the wide river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re done, stranger,&rdquo; said the man called Tom. &ldquo;I
done my best, but he&rsquo;s run from us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can swim to the bank,&rdquo; said Mr. Wescott, noting
with what ease the man sustained himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then do so and leave me to my fate,&rdquo; replied Wescott.
&ldquo;You have already risked too much for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I quit a man in that way I reckon you&rsquo;d better
call round with a rope and string me up. It&rsquo;ll suit me fust
rate. Let the current take ye square; we&rsquo;ll fetch up somewhere
I reckon, and when we do, and I onc&rsquo;t git on the trail
of that Dick Garrett, won&rsquo;t I make him howl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as he spoke the two men were moving on a course
diagonal with the current, the stronger man giving all the
support he could to his wounded companion. But the shore
seemed far away and Wescott felt that he could not go much
further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save yourself,&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;My wound has opened
again and I am losing strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; replied Tom, through his set teeth.
&ldquo;Hold up a little; I&rsquo;ll save you yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no hope,&rdquo; replied Wescott. &ldquo;Avenge me if
you can and save my daughter from that villain. You can
do me better service in that way than by staying with me
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment the surge came down heavily and buried
the speaker beneath the water. Tom paddled to and fro,
looking for him in vain, for the water had claimed its prey,
and nerving himself to the task the young man struck out
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
resolutely for the shore, which he reached nearly exhausted.
Then he ran along the bank and looked for some sign of
Wescott, but he looked in vain. The surface of the river
was blank.</p>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER VIII.</span>
<br />MELTON&rsquo;S SCOUT&mdash;A BUSH FIGHT.</h2>
<p>Tom Bantry had been a flatboatman since he was old
enough to hold a pole, and now for the first time paused to
consider how far he had gone down the road of sin. He
was conscious of many evil deeds already performed, but the
stain of blood was not upon his soul, and although pledged
to his vile companion he could not stand by tamely and
witness the murder of so good a man as Samuel Wescott.
But his good intentions had come to naught, and the brave
man was dead.</p>
<p>The flatboatman rose and looked about him, a wicked light
coming over his dark face. &ldquo;They taught me evil, them
cusses did,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d the making of a man in me,
but they sp&rsquo;iled me, and now they&rsquo;ve killed as good a man
as ever walked the earth. I&rsquo;ll remember that ag&rsquo;inst ye, old
man Garrett.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was literally worn out, and dropped down upon the
grass and slept until morning. He woke at last and started
up refreshed, only to find a party of white men were upon
the opposite bank, and with his paint upon him, Tom knew
that it would be far from safe to meet them, and he skulked
away, keeping under cover of the bushes, and then made a
circuit through the bushes, designing to cross their path and
ascertain who they were. As he crept forward with that
intention, he heard a slight rustling in the bushes in front,
and the long, snake-like head of Napope appeared above the
bushes, signaling him to fall back. He did so, involuntarily
dropping his hand upon his knife, which he had not lost
in the last night&rsquo;s struggle in the stream, when he remembered
that Napope regarded all his party as friends and that
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
he still wore the garb of an Indian. He dropped back and
the next moment Napope joined him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The white dogs come,&rdquo; he said, in a fierce tone, &ldquo;and
the heart of a chief is big in his bosom. They shall die
without knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo; demanded Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are white and they are not the friends of Jackwood
the son of Red-Bird. Where is your gun, my brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I lost it last night,&rdquo; replied Tom, a little embarrassed.
&ldquo;Let me look out and see what white men come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He advanced to the edge of the woods and looked out,
and could detect a white party moving hastily across the
plain. Foremost among them was a man whom he had
known well some years before, Cooney Joe, and behind him
came Captain Melton and his gallant men, and it flashed
through the mind of Tom Bantry that they were in pursuit
of Dick Garrett. His heart stood still, for a backward glance
showed him fifty stout Sacs, armed to the teeth, lying under
the bushes waiting for the coming of the hated white men.
Twenty-four hours ago Tom Bantry would have delighted
in this, but now he was changed, and racked his brains for
ways and means to acquaint them with the ambush before
them, without destruction to himself.</p>
<p>Napope waved his hand, and, as if by magic, every warrior
disappeared, and a stillness like that of death fell upon
the scene. The whites came in rapidly, unsuspicious of
danger, and passed through the first bushes, when they were
surprised to hear a sudden crash and a yell of surprise and
anger. The crash came from Tom Bantry, who had managed
to fall down with a great noise, at the same time giving
the yell which startled the white rangers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tree, boys!&rdquo; yelled Cooney Joe. &ldquo;Tree and fight. Injins
thar, by the big horn spoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men who followed Cooney Joe were Indian-fighters
of the first class, and the order had scarcely been given when
every man was sheltered by a tree and had his rifle ready for
action. This was not done a moment too soon, for the feathers
of the savages began to show above the bushes, and
several shots were fired, until a commanding voice shouted
to the warriors to hold their fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do the white men seek?&rdquo; cried Napope. &ldquo;They
have been beaten once; must we beat them again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Napope,&rdquo; cried Cooney Joe. &ldquo;I know the old
cuss, and he kin fight, if he is an Injin; but we&rsquo;ll lick him
out of his moccasins. Say, Injin, you&rsquo;d better clear the
way; you ain&rsquo;t got the major to fight now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Napope does not seek the scalps of the white men,&rdquo;
cried the Indian. &ldquo;If they bring the scalps to him, he will
take them, but he does not thirst for blood. Let Captain
Melton turn back and cross the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The path must be clear for me to pass through,&rdquo; replied
Melton. &ldquo;The hatchet has been dug up and its edge turned
against women and children, and the good white man, Wescott,
with his daughter, has been carried away, and we think
the Sacs know where they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Sacs do not know,&rdquo; replied Napope, proudly. &ldquo;Does
the white man take us for Menomonies or Chippewas? The
Sacs are men and not dogs; they do not fight against women
and children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Napope is a brave man, and will not lie to save his life,&rdquo;
said Melton. &ldquo;Let us pass on safely, and then there shall be
no blood shed, for we seek only those who have stolen the
brave man Wescott and his child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother must turn back,&rdquo; replied the chief. &ldquo;There
is no path over the Indian country for white soldiers until
peace is made; but if the good white man and his child are
here, they shall be made welcome, and no harm shall come
to them if Napope can give them aid. But Melton must
take his warriors and go back to his people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will not turn back,&rdquo; replied Melton, angrily, &ldquo;unless
we take the friends we seek with us. Let Napope clear the
way, or we will try to go on without his leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The white men will find knives and hatchets in the
path,&rdquo; replied the chief, grimly. &ldquo;Go back as you came,
and all shall be well; refuse, and you shall find that my
young men carry guns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this,&rdquo; whispered Cooney Joe in the ear of
Melton. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got twice as many warriors as we have,
and the chances are good for a fight. I never like to back
out, but I don&rsquo;t know but it&rsquo;s the safest plan.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; said Melton. &ldquo;These scoundrels will get
too impudent if they are allowed their own way too much.
There must be a fight, and at once, and the boys must do
their best. I know them too well to think that they will
back down for twice their number of Sacs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does my brother say?&rdquo; cried Napope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fight.&rdquo; replied Melton. &ldquo;We will go on.&rdquo; Napope disappeared
immediately, and scarcely had he done so when a
bullet whizzed by the ear of the young scout as he hastily
took to a tree. The fight now commenced in true Indian-fashion,
the Sacs forcing the fighting and running from tree
to tree to get nearer to their enemies. But they found a different
party from that with which they had fought upon
Sycamore Creek. Every bullet had its billet. Did an Indian
show hand or foot from behind his shelter, it was at once the
mark of a well-aimed ball. The men who followed Melton
had lived by the rifle, and were not likely to miss their aim
easily, while the Indians were notoriously bad marksmen, not
having the patience to perfect themselves in the use of
the rifle.</p>
<p>Besides, the weapons they carried were not of the best description,
being those furnished by the traders against the
law, and their powder was &ldquo;contract,&rdquo; warranted not to burn
except at a slow fire. But their numbers made the position
of Melton&rsquo;s small force decidedly unsafe, and they began to
close in upon every side, and every moment Melton expected
a charge with hatchet and knife, most fearful weapons in
Indian hands. But the steady valor of the scouts had inspired
the savages with a respect for them, and they fought
warily, losing a man now and then, and inflicting little
damage upon the foe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll charge soon, boys,&rdquo; whispered Cooney Joe.
&ldquo;Pass the word down the line to have a charge ready for the
rush. Don&rsquo;t throw away a shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rifles were ready when Napope gave the order, and at
his signal-yell they bounded out like tigers, flourishing their
bright weapons in the air.</p>
<p>This was the moment for the Border Riflemen, and each
picked his man and fired, and every bullet found a mark.
Supposing the rifles empty, the Sacs rushed on, but they were
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
mistaken, for up rose ten more riflemen, and the head of the
assailants seemed to melt away before their fire. It was more
than Indian endurance was equal to, and they again buried
themselves in the bushes, in spite of the fierce orders of Napope,
who, although severely wounded in the shoulder, urged
the men on.</p>
<p>He was ably seconded by Na-she-eschuck, who was also
slightly wounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well done, my lads,&rdquo; cried Mellon. &ldquo;Bravely done,
riflemen; they have not Sycamore Creek to brag of this time,
at any rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Napope collected his men under cover of the bushes, but
his heart was full of anger against the gallant band of scouts,
whom he had expected to sweep from the path in that headlong
charge. So far from doing that, over one-third of his
men were placed <i>hors de combat</i>, and several more partially
disabled. Aroused by the invectives of the two chiefs, they
again began to advance, but more cautiously, sliding from tree
to tree, with great care, and exposing themselves as little as
possible in doing so. But the riflemen managed to inflict new
damage upon them before they came in fair charging distance.
Napope had separated his force into three parts, sending
out a small party upon each flank of the white force, and
Melton was compelled to detach eight men, four upon each
flank, to keep off these troublesome flanking-parties. This
left him but twelve men in his main force, opposed to over
thirty determined warriors, eager for the blood of those who
had slain so many of their friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have got ourselves into a pizen scrape, Cap,&rdquo; said
Cooney Joe, as he stood with his back against a tree, looking
to the priming of his rifle; &ldquo;but thar&rsquo;s only one way to do,
and that is to fight our way out. We kin lick &rsquo;em if more
don&rsquo;t come; <i>that&rsquo;s</i> what I&rsquo;m afraid of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment the rush was made, and as before, the
whites divided their fire, so as to give the Indians two volleys
before they reached the trees, and then with yells which vied
with those of the Indians, they formed a line among the trees,
and beat back the savages with knife, hatchet, and clubbed
rifle. It was a desperate affair while it lasted, and the wild
valor of the scouting party prevailed, and they were driving
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
back the Indians step by step, when one of the men who had
been sent to the right flank came running up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Party of Injins coming across the plain, on a run, Cap,&rdquo;
he reported. &ldquo;I reckon we&rsquo;d better git.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easier said than done,&rdquo; said the captain, turning aside a
blow with his heavy knife. &ldquo;Shoot that fellow, Ed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The borderer brought his rifle to his shoulder, and the
savage fell, shot through the heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have the Indians on the flanks retreated, Ed?&rdquo; demanded
Melton, as he fired a pistol at a savage who was poising
his hatchet for a throw, and the savage went down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they ain&rsquo;t all gone yet,&rdquo; replied the man, who was
coolly reloading his discharged rifle. &ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;d better
call in the men and make a rush through these red devils,
before the others can come up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A signal whistle, well known to the &ldquo;merry men&rdquo; of Melton,
brought in all upon the flank, and with shouts of victory,
all charged upon the broken and demoralized body of Sacs.
They had fought bravely, but their courage was not proof
against the assault, and they broke and fled in every direction
through the woods, pursued by the victorious whites, who
only wanted to get deeper into the woods, to avoid the force
coming up in their rear. They would not have done this had
they known that it was Dick Garrett and his party, bringing
as prisoner, Sadie Wescott, whom Minneoba would not
leave.</p>
<p>Scouts from the party of Napope having discovered the
coming of the disguised whites, and apprised the chief, he
hurried out to meet them, and started as he saw who they
held as prisoner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Then it is my brother who struck the
wigwam of Wescott, and took him prisoner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Garrett. &ldquo;You see our boss, Will Jackwood,
wanted this girl, and sent me to take her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Wescott, now?&rdquo; demanded Napope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Garrett, hesitating, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s gone under; that&rsquo;s
what&rsquo;s the matter with <i>him</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let my brother speak more plainly,&rdquo; said the chief.
&ldquo;What has become of Wescott, the good white man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has been murdered,&rdquo; replied Sadie, coming forward,
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
quickly. &ldquo;Chief, you know what he was, and that he never
willingly wronged the Indians. You know, too, that when
the mob in the village assaulted Black-Hawk and yourself, he
came to your aid and helped you to escape. He has been
brutally murdered, by this base wretch, Garrett.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The girl lies, I reckon,&rdquo; said Garrett, sullenly. &ldquo;See
here, chief; is it calculated in your tribe that women are any
better off for having too much tongue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother must let the Wild Rose speak,&rdquo; replied Napope.
&ldquo;When the Sacs come hungry and thirsty into her
father&rsquo;s lodge, she is always ready to give them food and
drink; when they are weary, and the night air is cold, there
is always a warm place by the fire to spread a blanket. The
child of Wescott must be allowed to speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now look here, chief,&rdquo; said Garrett, in the same ferocious
tone. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t noways likely I&rsquo;m going to come down to you
or any man on earth. If Wescott was killed, he was my
pris&rsquo;ner, and I had a right to do what I would with him.
Have you any thing to say against it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Napope inclined his head slowly, as recognizing the justice
of the remark. The life of the man was as little regarded
by the Indians as by Garrett, and Napope rather liked the
tone of insolence he assumed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Napope,&rdquo; cried Sadie, &ldquo;I want you to listen to me.
This wicked man threw my father into the water, from the
flat-boat, and he has not been seen since. Will you see a
good man murdered and refuse to avenge him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Napope was evidently troubled, for just now he needed
the assistance of Garrett and his men, and did not wish to
make him angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will speak of that another time, Wild Rose. Until
then, rest safely with Minneoba, the daughter of Black-Hawk,
while we do the work of men. Garrett, do you
know that Loud Tempest is here and he has beaten the men
of Napope, and killed many?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Loud Tempest; do you mean Captain Melton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; he is here, with the white hunter Joe, and many
warriors. Napope can not rest until we have his scalp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cooney Joe! Why, I give him a lick last night that
ought to have settled any decent man for good.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>&ldquo;He is alive, and fights like a Sac,&rdquo; replied Napope.
&ldquo;They are in the woods and we must follow and take their
scalps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet he&rsquo;s arter me,&rdquo; muttered Garrett. &ldquo;He don&rsquo;t
owe me any good will for work I&rsquo;ve done, and I&rsquo;ve swore to
have his hair. Thar&rsquo;s my hand on it, Napope, and I&rsquo;ll never
quit you until he or I have gone under.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sadie had started at the name of Melton, and was conscious
of a feeling of joy that he had thought enough of her
safety to follow her into the Indian country, but, as she
glanced over the line of ferocious faces, she was sorry that
he had incurred this danger. But she followed the party
until they reached the battle-field and found it strewn with
the slain bodies of the Sacs who had fallen, each one pierced
by the deadly bullet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These ain&rsquo;t babies we are following,&rdquo; said Garrett.
&ldquo;They kin fight, Melton&rsquo;s scout kin, and ef we lick &rsquo;em we
lick a good crowd. How many has he got with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Napope extended the fingers upon both hands twice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty? We&rsquo;ve got our work cut out then, for twenty
of Melton&rsquo;s Mounted Rifles, with the capting and Cooney
Joe to lead, are a hard crowd to manage, bet your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was one of your men with us in this fight,&rdquo; said
Napope, looking about him for Tom Bantry. &ldquo;But I do not
see him now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was he?&rdquo; demanded Garrett, glancing over the
party hastily. &ldquo;Was it the one we call Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Napope nodded, and Garrett uttered an oath, and a search
was commenced for him. He was not among the dead or
wounded, and whether he had perished or not, Bantry was
not to be found.</p>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER IX.</span>
<br />THE DEFENSE OF THE ISLAND.</h2>
<p>When the enemy had been so scattered as to leave the
path free, the small band of rangers plunged deeper into the
woods and kept on their course until they reached a small
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
wooded swamp through which many small creeks ran, leaving
a little island in the center, containing, perhaps, two
acres of land. The tall trees stood thick about it, and no
better place of defense could possibly have been selected. No
sooner had they reached the island than they set to work
fortifying it by piling up fallen logs into a temporary barricade,
making it strongest upon the only point which could be
assailed by land, as the creeks swept around it on three sides,
leaving a space of smooth ground about twenty feet
wide. Across this they built a strong barricade at least ten
feet high, through the openings of which, they could fire
upon the foe, without being themselves seen.</p>
<p>The other parts of the island were almost impervious to
assault, for not only did the deep creek guard it, but the
logs had fallen all about it in inextricable confusion, making
a <i>chevaux de frise</i> through which a corps of axmen would
have found it extremely difficult to force their way. The
middle of the island was cleared, leaving the path open
for them to pass from one part to another, and they now
waited almost eagerly for the coming of the enemy, who, as
yet, did not appear. Cooney Joe took his rifle and stole
out toward the clearing, and for half an hour the &ldquo;scout&rdquo;
remained quiet, waiting in considerable anxiety for the
coming of the hunter, whose danger they well knew. But
he came back at a long-loping trot, his rifle at a trail, and
his eyes flashing with the ardor of battle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Git ready, boys,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got business afore
us, bet yer life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What now, Joe?&rdquo; demanded the captain. &ldquo;Who are
coming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All that&rsquo;s left of Napope&rsquo;s band and thirty of Dick Garrett&rsquo;s
men,&rdquo; replied Joe. &ldquo;And&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thar&rsquo;s an Injin,&rdquo; cried one of the men. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pop him
over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; replied Joe. &ldquo;Seems to me that chap is
making signals that look <i>white</i>. Thar; look at that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>An Indian had appeared in plain sight and was waving a
white cloth in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, <i>you</i>!&rdquo; yelled Joe. &ldquo;Come in, ef you want
to.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>The man obeyed and came clambering over the barricade,
and at a glance they could see that he was a white man disguised.
It was Tom Bantry, who had escaped from associates
with whom he could no longer consort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, men,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Tom Bantry. You
don&rsquo;t know <i>me</i> and mebbe you don&rsquo;t want to. I&rsquo;ve been one
of Dick Garrett and Will Jackwood&rsquo;s men&mdash;I have. Now
why don&rsquo;t you kill me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t see my way to that clear,&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;Now, Tom
Bantry, what d&rsquo;ye want here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve, quit &rsquo;em,&rdquo; replied Tom, energetically. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t
stand it, boys, &rsquo;pon my word, I couldn&rsquo;t. I feel mean as dirt
&rsquo;cause I&rsquo;ve been with &rsquo;em so long; but I tell you I didn&rsquo;t
think they was so mean till last night when they killed poor
Mr. Wescott.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you say?&rdquo; cried Melton, coming forward.
&ldquo;Who killed him; how was he killed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick Garrett did it,&rdquo; replied Tom, in a choking voice.
&ldquo;The &rsquo;square give him some cheek, and he had him throwed
into the river. Boys, I&rsquo;m a rough boatman, but I jumped in
after him, and they left us alone in the dark on the river. I
tried to save him, but it wan&rsquo;t no use; the current took him
under.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe this man, for one,&rdquo; said Melton. &ldquo;He never
would dare to come here with such a tale as that unless it
was really true. What do you say, boys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; replied Joe, &ldquo;but ef he ain&rsquo;t, let him look
out, &rsquo;cause I shoot awful close, odd times; I do, by gracious.
So Dick Garrett is jined with Napope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t all, you know,&rdquo; said Tom Bantry. &ldquo;They hev
sent off a messenger to the village, and if you don&rsquo;t have
lively times round here, then I don&rsquo;t want a picayune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we had better retreat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do it; they&rsquo;ve got scouts all through the
woods, and you&rsquo;d hev the hull posse on your backs in twenty
minnits by the clock, so don&rsquo;t try that on, &rsquo;square. No, it&rsquo;s
goin&rsquo; to be a b&rsquo;ar-fight, and you can&rsquo;t find a better place than
this to fight in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe the man is right,&rdquo; said Melton. &ldquo;I say, Folks,
is your hand so bad you can&rsquo;t pull a trigger?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry to say &rsquo;tis, Cap,&rdquo; replied the man; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had been hit in the hand during the fight that morning,
and the cords had been so injured as to make it impossible
for him to fire a rifle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you may as well let this man have your rifle,
Folks,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;I take it for granted you mean
to fight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stranger, I&rsquo;ve <i>got</i> to fight,&rdquo; said Bantry. &ldquo;Why, if Dick
Garrett gets me, he&rsquo;ll raise my wool, sure, and so, ef he does
git into this camp, I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; out feet fust. That&rsquo;s the way to
talk it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knows you have turned against him, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captin, he suspects it, and to suspect a man is all <i>he</i>
wants, you know. He&rsquo;ll go for me, sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man who had been hurt came up at this moment and
gave Bantry the rifle and ammunition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, &rsquo;square, see here,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you watch me when I
fire the first shot, and if it don&rsquo;t seem to you that I&rsquo;ve tried
to hit my man, I give you leave to shoot me, that&rsquo;s all. This
is a good rifle, chummy&mdash;she hangs true as a die, and I can
knock the black out of a buffler&rsquo;s eye at twenty rods
with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment one of the sentries outside the barricade
gave the signal, and all were immediately upon the alert.
Melton took the charge of Bantry upon himself, and gave
him a place in the middle of the barricade, and took his station
beside him. The sentries came stealing in like silent
specters, and placed themselves beside the rest in silence,
waiting for the advance of the Indians.</p>
<p>They had not long to wait, for a tufted head was cautiously
protruded from behind a tree, and a pair of brilliant eyes
looked keenly at the island. Evidently he saw something
out of the way, for he stepped out in full view of the fort
and advanced to within twenty feet of the barricade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That man must not go back,&rdquo; said Melton, in a whisper,
touching Tom Bantry on the arm, &ldquo;and no rifle must be
fired. Can you fetch him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bantry caught up a knife and hatchet, and sprung from the
barricade so suddenly that the Indian had no time to cock
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
his gun before the fiery boatman was upon him. They
closed with fierce energy, a short struggle ensued, and then
Tom Bantry arose, leaving the Indian dead at his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well done, Bantry,&rdquo; said Melton, as the man came back
his face scarcely flushed by the desperate struggle in which
he had been engaged. &ldquo;You will do very well without
watching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve <i>got</i> to fight,&rdquo; replied Tom, coolly. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do for
me to be caught, I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time the Indians and disguised boatmen began to
show themselves through the woods, and the scout opened
upon them at once, and they skulked to the shelter of the
bushes. But the men who had come up with the desperado
Garrett did not know the word fear, and only waited for the
orders of their superior to advance to the assault.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are fighting chickens, Cap; game birds, every
man, now you mind what I say,&rdquo; said the deserter. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll
fight like bulldogs, but they&rsquo;d do better if Black Will was
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The attack was not long delayed. The desperate ruffians
collected as close as possible to the barricade, and then made
their rush all together. They were met by men as determined
and desperate as themselves, and forced back, leaving
one fourth of their number dead or wounded in front of the
barricade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way Melton&rsquo;s scouts do it,&rdquo; cried the voice of
the young captain. &ldquo;Come again, my boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear you,&rdquo; screamed Garrett, &ldquo;and we will come again.
Now, Napope,&rdquo; he added, lowering his tone, &ldquo;we must divide
their force. Send ten of your best men to cross the creek
and attack them on the right. Send ten more to the left,
and try them at the same time. The signal will be three
rifle-shots from this point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their movements were not so well shrouded that Melton
could not see the danger to be apprehended from a division
of his forces, which was rendered necessary by this action on
their part. But he only sent three men to each point threatened,
one under the lead of Tom Bantry, who had already
become quite popular, and the other under Cooney Joe. They
darted rapidly across the little open space, while the others
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
loaded their rifles and pistols and calmly waited for the assault.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beat them off this time, and the chances are they won&rsquo;t
want any more,&rdquo; cried Melton. &ldquo;Shoot a little closer to
make up for the lost men, and it will be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then they heard three rifle-shots, and a simultaneous
movement was made against the island from three different
points. But the foresight of Melton in sending small parties
to the threatened points, removed the danger from the two
parties of Indians, while his own force was not so weakened
but that he could still present a stout front to the foe. The
barricade rained bullets upon the advancing enemy entangled
in the branches of the trees which formed the intrenchment,
and crowded into the narrow space of twenty feet. No men,
however hardy, could hope to live long under such a fire, and
in spite of the almost superhuman exertions of Garrett, Napope
and Na-she-eschuck, they fell back again, and took
breath under cover of the woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is awful,&rdquo; said Garrett. &ldquo;The curse of the devil on
them, how they do fight. I&rsquo;ve lost near half my men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The small parties under Tom Bantry and Joe had succeeded
in keeping their enemies at bay, and as soon as the
main body retreated, half a dozen men ran to their aid, and
the Indians were quickly swept away from the banks of the
creek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good boys,&rdquo; said Melton. &ldquo;You could not fight better if
you liked the sport. Now, who wants the doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one had been badly injured. Two or three had been
scraped by passing bullets, but a little sticking-plaster soon set
that right, and they were as ready for a fight as ever.</p>
<p>Garrett was furious, and while he was blaming heaven and
earth at the ill success of his attack, a man whose face was
flushed by a hard ride dashed through the swamp, and drew
up before them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, what is all this?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I know you,
Dick Garrett. You delight in a row so much that you are
wasting my men in attacking a perfect fort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t know who is in it, Will Jackwood,&rdquo; replied
Garrett. &ldquo;Two men you hate&mdash;Cooney Joe and Captain
Melton.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, say you so? Then out of that they must come, by
the Eternal! Keep back the men, for Black-Hawk will be
here in half an hour with four hundred braves, and then we
will overwhelm them. Captain Melton, eh? I always did
detest that boy, Dick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t love him,&rdquo; said Dick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this I hear about Sam Wescott?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone under, Will. I had to do it, for he recognized me
in my disguise, and some one had to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care so much about that, if you did not compromise
me. The man hated me, and while he lived there was
no hope of winning the girl by fair means, and I always liked
that way best. Where is the girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left her on the edge of the swamp, with three of my
best men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; where is Tom Bantry? I want to send him
somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to think about him, Will, &rsquo;pon my
word. When we slung Wescott overboard the fool jumped
after him, and I left them both in the river. Tom got out,
some way, and came to Napope&rsquo;s camp, but after their fight
we could not find hide nor hair of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve lost the best man in the party, then, by all odds.
Tom was the only one who had a spark of humanity in his
composition. You are sure these men you left with the girl
are all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Davis, Bradshaw and Herrick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll do; as true panthers as ever lapped blood. How
many has Melton in his fort?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He <i>had</i> twenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he&rsquo;s got twenty <i>now</i>,&rdquo; said Jackwood. &ldquo;You have
not hurt many of them in that place, for the captain knows
how to choose a position. Send one of the Indians to Black-Hawk,
and tell him to make haste, as we must get this little
job off our hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you find it a little job, then there are no snakes in the
South Red,&rdquo; said Garrett, who was incensed at the quiet way
in which his defeat was laughed down. &ldquo;They licked Napope
alone, and now they&rsquo;ve licked our combined forces, and
it is no two to one they don&rsquo;t give our friend Black-Hawk
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
all he can do. <i>You</i> ought to know Melton&rsquo;s scouts by this
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jackwood nodded, and a fierce look came into his face:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had been here, friend Garrett, this would never have
happened. If <i>I</i> had assailed these works, I would have taken
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then assail them now. You&rsquo;ve got the men&mdash;try it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick&mdash;Dick! How lucky it is that all men are not
swayed by impulse. You offer me a broken and discouraged
force to perform the task you failed to achieve when they
were in prime order. It won&rsquo;t do, Richard; too transparent
altogether. Get the men together, see to the wounded and
get the survivors ready for a new attack. I will lead it in
person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, the approach of dusky scouts heralded the
coming of Black-Hawk, and directly after the old chief, surrounded
by his principal advisers and warriors, strode into the
camp.</p>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER X.</span>
<br />THE FOREST FIEND.</h2>
<p>Will Jackwood, whose influence over the old chief had
now become great, at once accosted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The time has come, chief of the Sacs, when you may
put forth your hand and take that which is your own, the
band of men who have braved the power of Napope and
his strongest men, and have even baffled my warriors. They
laugh at us in yonder fort; let us teach them what we can
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother speaks good words,&rdquo; replied the chief.
&ldquo;Let those who have axes go forward and fell trees about
the fort upon every side so that we may cross the creek.
Let others take their guns and protect them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A cordon of axmen was quickly formed, about the island,
and the great trees came crashing down, forming
bridges over which the great force of warriors could rush
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
to the attack. The work was quickly done, and then at the
command of the chief four hundred warriors rushed on together,
uttering their fearful war-cries. They broke through
the abatis of tangled limbs unopposed and reached the fort
only to find it tenantless. The white rangers had escaped,
how they could not tell, leaving nothing to show where they
had departed, but all knew that it must have been in the interval
of time which elapsed between the last attack on the
fort and the coming of Black-Hawk. Black Will was nearly
beside himself with anger, and a pursuit was at once commenced,
when the trail was found. But, the &ldquo;scout&rdquo; had
half an hour&rsquo;s start, and he feared that they would reach the
river before they could be overtaken, and their leader&rsquo;s fertile
brain would quickly study out some way of crossing the
stream.</p>
<p>Although having but little hope, Black-Hawk sent out
a hundred of the best Sac warriors under the command of
Ma-she-eschuck, and the pursuit was pressed with ardor.
While this was being done, Jackwood sent Garrett with five
men to find Sadie, and conduct her to a place of safety, strictly
enjoining him to use her well but upon no account to suffer
her to escape.</p>
<p>Dick Garrett hurried his men to the spot where he had
left Sadie, and as he approached it his countenance began to
change for he heard nothing of the men he had left in charge
of the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up, boys,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;if they have lost her, I&rsquo;ll
not be the man to go back to Black Will Jackwood and tell
him of it. Ha! Look at that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three men who had been left with Sadie lay upon
the earth under the shadow of the trees. Their faces were
upturned to the sky, and it needed no prophet to tell that
they were dead, and the party broke into a run and reached
the spot. Two of them had been shot through the heart,
evidently with pistol balls, and the third had half a dozen
knife wounds upon him, and they saw on every hand evidences
of a desperate struggle, while Sadie was nowhere to
be seen. The men paused and looked at each other in unspeakable
dismay, for they knew Jackwood too well to dare
face him, and tell him what had happened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d kill me!&rdquo; screamed Garrett. &ldquo;Look here, boys;
we&rsquo;ve got to find this girl before we go back, so take the
trail at once, and follow. We&rsquo;ll have her back, if she is
above ground, and avenge these poor fellows who lie dead.
I only wish we had Tom Bantry now; he was the best scout
among us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What made you leave him in the river then?&rdquo; said one
of the men, in a sullen tone. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t come back no
more, Tom won&rsquo;t, and like enuff he&rsquo;ll turn against us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be mutinous, Tracey,&rdquo; said Garrett, turning a dark
look upon the speaker. &ldquo;You know <i>me</i>, and you know I
never waste words. Be mighty careful; <i>I</i> would, if I was
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man understood the deadly threat implied in the
words of his leader, and turned away muttering to him
self.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now Jack Fish,&rdquo; said Dick, addressing himself to another
of the party, &ldquo;if Tracey has done growling, you take
the trail. &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t likely that a young and tender girl can
keep away from us long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man addressed came forward, and waving the others
back began to examine the earth to find the imprint of Sadie&rsquo;s
feet. It was not long before he announced that he had
found it, and that it was covered by another trail, that
of a man in moccasins, who was apparently following her,
and from the length of the step he should say they were
running.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That looks as if she was afraid of the critter,&rdquo; said Garrett.
&ldquo;Who can it be that is brave enough to attack these
men, shoot two and kill the third with a knife and get off so
easily? Now, I&rsquo;ll tell you what I make of this, boys. When
this man, whoever he is, shot down two of the boys and
rushed in on Davis with the knife, the girl was scared and
put out for the woods. When he had finished Davis&mdash;and
he didn&rsquo;t do it easy&mdash;he went after her, and like as not he
hasn&rsquo;t caught her yet. Take the trail, Jack, but have your
weapons handy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was yet early in the afternoon and the trail was plain,
as no attempt had been made to cover it. They went on at
a trot, Jack Fish in advance, closely followed by Garrett and
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
the rest, and the course led them deep into the woods to
the right of the position which had been so nobly held by
Melton&rsquo;s scout. Sadie was used to exercise in the open
air and was evidently leading her pursuer a desperate chase,
using every artifice to throw him from the trail. Garret was
dumbfounded, for he could not understand why she should
fly from one who had slain her enemies, but they followed
the trail, hoping every moment to overtake the man who was
in chase of Sadie. All at once, Jack Fish, who still held
the advance, stopped and lifted his hand, with a low
cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Dick, this gal is cute, you bet. She has throwed
him off the trail as sure as shootin&rsquo;. Thar&rsquo;s no track but
his&rsquo;n here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick eagerly inspected the trail and was forced to arrive
at the same conclusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn back, then,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;We will find which way
she has gone and follow. I will take the trail on one side
and you on the other and we will soon pick it up again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had not gone back twenty paces when Jack Fish
stopped beside a clump of thick bushes which grew close to
the path, and stooping, looked under them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found it, boys. She crept under the bushes here and
got away from him; follow me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He passed through the bushes, parting them carefully, and
upon the other side found the trail clearly defined and leading
at a right angle from the course they had been following.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s smart,&rdquo; said Garrett, admiringly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as
I blame Will for liking her, after all. She has beaten this
fellow well, and as we don&rsquo;t want any thing from him just
now, we&rsquo;ll follow the girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They kept on swiftly, for Jack announced that Sadie was
fatigued at this point and was no longer running. Soon
after they reached a place where, worn out by fatigue, she
had seated herself upon a bank and rested for a little time.
From this point the trail became erratic, and she was evidently
wandering up and down seeking for some course out
of the woods, and the night found them still upon the trail
and they camped for the night determined to take the trail
again at early morning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll run her to earth before nine o&rsquo;clock, you
mark my words,&rdquo; said Garrett. &ldquo;Lucky for you I am your
leader, or you would have gone back to meet Will Jackwood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if I knows it,&rdquo; said Tracey. &ldquo;Will Jackwood never
sees me again if we don&rsquo;t find her in the morning. Now I
think of it, where is the Indian girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought of her,&rdquo; said Garrett. &ldquo;Can it be possible
that <i>she</i> killed the men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, bosh; she only had a bow and arrows and it took a
strong man to harness Joel Davis. I&rsquo;ll be cussed if I understand
it at all. Say, Jack, did you see any thing of the Indian
girl&rsquo;s trail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She went another way from the camp, on a run too. It
must have been some awful looking critter that tackled Joel
Davis, to skeer the girls so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said Garrett. &ldquo;Now then, as Jack has
worked hard and we want him to lead again to-morrow,
Tracey will keep camp for two hours and the rest of you as you
can agree, until morning. I&rsquo;m going to have a snooze, myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wrapped himself in a blanket and threw himself down
at the foot of a tree, while the rest in a discontented manner
drew lots for the choice of the hours of watching. After
this had been settled the lucky ones took their blankets and
lay down, while Tracey lighted his pipe, moved out a short
distance in the darkness and sat down to watch. The man
was sullen, and had not yet got over his little brush with
Garrett upon the fate of Tom Bantry, and he muttered to
himself about the pride of rank which enabled Garrett to sleep,
while he was forced to watch.</p>
<p>They built no fire, for it was a clear summer night and
even the blankets were scarcely needed. Tracey&rsquo;s pipe
glowed through the night, showing those of his companions
who yet slept, where he sat in the shadow. After a time
the man began to doze, and did not see the dark figure that
crawled slowly toward him until it stood erect against the
trunk of the tree against which he was seated. A moment
after, a long arm was stretched out and clutched his throat in
so fell a clasp that it seemed to collapse beneath the pressure,
and in a moment more he lay without a struggle or a groan
supine beneath the tree.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>The strange being who had done the work, bent over the
insensible form and was busy about something for a short
time, and then taking up the pipe which Tracey had dropped
and which had not been extinguished, he sat down near the
body of the fallen renegade and began to smoke, first picking
up the cap of his victim and placing it upon his head,
glancing now and then at the sleeping camp. When the
pipe was smoked out he arose and stole softly to the side of
Dick Garrett and looked down into his face.</p>
<p>The moonlight shone full upon him, and showed a horrible
figure of gigantic mold, covered from head to foot with a
hairy substance, while the eyes looked fiercely from his shaggy
eyebrows upon the sleeping ruffian. His attitude was menacing,
and once or twice the right hand dropped to a hairy girdle
about his waist, as if to draw a huge knife which was suspended
there, but upon second thought he seemed to change his
mind, and gathering up the rifles of the party, he carried them
a little distance into the woods, and returned this time to take
away the knives and pistols, most of which were thrown together
in a heap, at the place where the rifles had been stacked.
Some of the villains had their small-arms upon their
persons, but these the intruder did not attempt to touch, and
waving his hands triumphantly above his head, he bounded
into the thicket, and was seen no more.</p>
<p>Daylight came and they began to yawn and stretch themselves,
those who ought to have gone upon guard long before,
looking mystified at being allowed to sleep until morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tracey went to sleep, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said Garrett. &ldquo;Go and
kick the brute, somebody. There is no telling what might
have happened through his cussed carelessness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the men sprung to the spot where the recumbent
figure of Tracey was seen, and had actually drawn back his
foot to kick him, when he saw that his hands were tightly
bound, and a gag thrust into his mouth. His cry of astonishment
awoke the rest, and they quickly surrounded their fallen
comrade, relieved him of the ligatures, and helped him to arise.
The eyes of the man were rolling fearfully, and he gasped for
breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; he said, at last. &ldquo;A pretty set of fellows you are,
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
to let a man stay in that way all night. Dunderheads&mdash;sleepers&mdash;ten
thousand curses on your heads!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady, Tracey,&rdquo; said Garrett. &ldquo;What does this
mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means you are a lot of lazy thieves, or you would have
found this out four hours ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who did it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I know? I was sitting there smoking my pipe,
when I felt a great hairy hand upon my throat, and I was
choking. Then I lost my senses, and when I came to myself,
I was lying here, anchored to the tree, and unable to
move hand or foot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you sing out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t I fly?&rdquo; retorted Tracey, angrily. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
be a fool if I were you, Dick Garrett. Oh, curse the hand,
whoever it was. Where&rsquo;s my rifle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question naturally drew their attention to their own
weapons, and as they noted the loss, curses both loud and
deep were vented upon the head of the being who had done
this injury to them. Garrett actually foamed at the mouth
in his anger, and ran in a frantic manner up and down the
camp, cursing Tracey, their unknown enemy, any thing and
every thing under the sun, in no measured terms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; said Tracey. &ldquo;Curse your own sleepy heads,
and let me alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look for sign, Jack Fish,&rdquo; said Garrett, turning to their
trailer. &ldquo;Tell me who has done this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same man that killed the boys, and then followed
Miss Sadie,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Hyar&rsquo;s his trail, plain as writing,
and I&rsquo;ll be cussed if it don&rsquo;t beat me to tell whether he&rsquo;s
man or beast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He shall not beat me,&rdquo; hissed Dick Garrett. &ldquo;Take the
trail of the girl and follow, for we&rsquo;ll have her now, rifles or
no rifles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trailer obeyed without a word, and they started out
upon the trail. But, as they emerged from the woods and
entered a great clearing, every man paused in alarm, for
there, just in front, and covering them with one of their own
rifles, while the rest lay at his feet, stood the hairy monster
who had stolen in upon their camp the night before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; he cried, in a hoarse, unnatural voice. &ldquo;For
your lives, stop. Move hand or foot and you are dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They halted, and stood facing the leveled tube, trembling
in every joint, while the fierce eyes, glancing along the brown
barrel, held them enthralled.</p>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER XI.</span>
<br />BLACK-HAWK KEEPS HIS WORD.</h2>
<p>We left Sadie in charge of those desperadoes, while the
battle in the swamp was progressing. They were sulky at
not being allowed to take part in the fight, and only returned
gruff answers to her questions, while keeping a strict watch
upon the girls.</p>
<p>They stood under a great tree, whose spreading branches,
loaded with foliage, were impenetrable to the eye, and would
have formed a secure hiding-place, and none of them saw the
long, hairy arm extended, until a double report stretched two
of the guards dead upon the sod. Then came a rustling
sound, and the gigantic being, who afterward appeared to the
men of Garrett in the woods, bounded from the tree, holding
in his hand a gleaming knife. With a scream of horror,
Sadie fled into the forest, and Minneoba, believing that she
saw a demon of the lower world, also turned in flight, but
paused upon the edge of the woods, and looked back to see
a fearful duel between the man named Davis and the strange
being who sprung from the tree. They seemed to be complete
masters of their weapons, and for a moment the issue
seemed doubtful, but the gigantic strength of the unknown
prevailed, and Davis fell, covered with many wounds. The
victor stood erect, and seeing that Sadie had fled, uttered a
hoarse cry, and fixing his eyes upon her trail, bounded away
in pursuit. Minneoba, like all Indian girls, was superstitious,
and believed that it would be death to follow the wild being
into the woods, and turning, hurried on toward Black-Hawk&rsquo;s
camp, intending to ask aid from him in the recovery of her
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
friend. Sadie, in the mean time, had put all the distance she
could between herself and the hideous being who had assailed
her guards, and was hurried in her flight by hearing his deep
voice crying out after her, as she rushed on.</p>
<p>She tried every trick of wood-craft which she had learned
from her father&mdash;who was a skillful scout&mdash;when she became
certain that the horrible creature was really in pursuit. How
she finally eluded him by creeping beneath the bushes, and
then turning away from the course she had been pursuing, we
have before seen, and late in the afternoon she found herself
in the midst of a deep forest, pathless as the sea, not knowing
which way to turn. She was alone&mdash;alone in the
depths of that untrodden wilderness, the haunt of wild
beasts and the hunter who followed them, without a weapon
or guide. Never, perhaps, was a tenderly-nurtured woman
placed in so strange a situation before. Look which way she
would, there seemed to be no hope of succor. Strange
sights and sounds were heard, slimy snakes crept softly over
the leaves, great birds flitted through the branches, and she
heard the cry of the wildcat and panther in the distance.
Wearied and hopeless, she sunk down upon a mossy knoll,
and almost wished she had not fled from the monster who
followed her. But it would not do to remain there, and she
rose and staggered on her way, hoping against hope that
something would happen to give her aid.</p>
<p>She was nearly famished, and coming upon a place where
the succulent bulb known as the &ldquo;ground-nut&rdquo; grew in profusion,
she set to work and dug up the bulbs with her fingers,
following the white stems in their various turnings among the
roots until she found the article she sought. It took a long
time to satisfy her hunger, as the nuts were not larger than a
rifle ball, and were hard to find, and then she began to look
about for a place of rest, as it would soon be dark. She
reached a great opening, in the center of which a huge pile
of logs and brush was heaped, and removing some of these,
made a couch for herself among the branches, drew others
over her head, and resigned herself to an All-protecting
Power. Even in times of difficulty and danger sleep will
come to the weary, and she lost consciousness, and no longer
feared her enemies. Morning came and found the sweet girl
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
still sleeping, when she was suddenly aroused by a harsh
voice crying out a deadly menace, and peeping from her
place of concealment, saw the Forest Fiend facing the knot
of helpless scoundrels under the leadership of Dick Garrett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a man, after all,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Perhaps I would
have done better to have let him overtake me, for it seems he
fights against these villains. Perhaps he is mad, poor
creature!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make a rush on him altogether, boys,&rdquo; whispered
Garrett. &ldquo;Curse it, five men ought to whip one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s got the rifles, the critter,&rdquo; whined Tracey. &ldquo;I
tell you that if you had been in his grip once, you wouldn&rsquo;t
be so ready to try him again. He&rsquo;s got a hold like an iron
vice, that devil has.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to run,&rdquo; cried the Forest Fiend. &ldquo;It will not
be safe; he who flies first, dies first!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want from us?&rdquo; screamed Garrett. &ldquo;Do
you know who I am, curse you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you,&rdquo; replied the strange being, wildly. &ldquo;You
are a murderer and a robber, and deserve death for a hundred
crimes. Why don&rsquo;t you come on? what are you afraid
of? You tremble at the sight of the Forest Fiend, murderer
that you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you back me, boys?&rdquo; hissed Garrett; &ldquo;I tell you
I&rsquo;ll be the first to rush at him, if you will agree to follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can kill three of us before we get within striking distance,&rdquo;
replied Jack Fish. &ldquo;I guess we had better give up
boys; maybe he&rsquo;ll let us off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garrett heard what he said, and thrusting his hand into
the bosom of his hunting-shirt, drew a long double-barreled
pistol, his eyes gleaming with rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d turn traitor, would you?&rdquo; he screamed. &ldquo;Now
see here, rush on that devil, you and Tracey, or I shoot you
where you stand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it, Dick,&rdquo; pleaded Jack Fish, dropping on his
knees. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fight any thing human, but not that dreadful
creature. Don&rsquo;t force us on him, for the love of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; replied Garrett, fiercely. &ldquo;Up and at him,
you base hounds; up, I say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Goaded on by fear of the weapon of their leader, the men
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
sprung on, catching up clubs as they ran. But when they
had gained a hundred feet from the weapon of Garrett, and
where it would scarcely reach them, they threw up their
hands in token of submission, and fell upon their faces. The
Forest Fiend fired over them, and a man who stood at Garrett&rsquo;s
elbow fell, shot through the heart. The others, who
had each a pistol, seeing that nothing was to be gained by
flight, rushed at the immovable figure of their enemy, who
caught up another weapon and fired again, killing the foremost
man. Garrett saw that there was no hope, and calling
to the last man, sprung toward the thicket. Hearing the
crack of the rifle, he turned back and saw his friend fall,
while the stern executioner caught up another rifle and leveled
it. As the bullet sped, Garrett sprung into the air and
fell upon his face, just as Jack Fish and Tracey, who had
taken advantage of their opportunity, reached the thicket in
safety.</p>
<p>Their terrible adversary sprung toward the fallen leader
without waiting to reload his weapon or take up a new one,
but to his rage Garrett uttered a loud laugh of derision and
sprung to his feet, and the next moment the leaves concealed
him from view. He had been &ldquo;playing &rsquo;possum,&rdquo; and was
not hurt in the least, as he had managed to fall just in time
to escape the well-aimed bullet. The Forest Fiend darted
back for a rifle, but he was a moment too late, although he
fired into the thicket, and then, snatching up a powder-horn
and bullet-pouch, darted away in pursuit.</p>
<p>The moment he was gone Sadie came out of her place of
concealment, selected a rifle and ammunition from the heap,
and hurried away, glad of the opportunity to get out of a
dangerous neighborhood. She could not control her fear
of the strange being who had come to her aid so opportunely,
and continued her flight until she felt safe from pursuit,
and then sat down, panting, loaded the rifle which
she had taken, and prepared to defend herself from any assault.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who and what is that wonderful being?&rdquo; she murmured.
&ldquo;How brave he is; how little he cared for that gang
of desperate scoundrels, who were doubtless in pursuit of
us! Oh, I hope he may overtake Richard Garrett and
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
avenge the murder of my poor father! Melton, where are
you? Have you fallen a victim to these base wretches who
regard human life as a plaything? God forbid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she was rising to proceed upon her way she heard a
slight rustle among the bushes, and grasping her rifle turned
in the direction of the sound. But she dropped the weapon
with a cry of delight, for the bushes parted and Minneoba
suddenly appeared and ran to her white sister, clasping her
in her arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sadie, my sister,&rdquo; she said, softly kissing her again and
again. &ldquo;The heart of Minneoba has been very sad. She
feared that the evil demon of the woods had destroyed the
Wild Rose, and that her poor Indian sister would never see
the face she loved again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Minneoba was delighted, how much greater was the
joy of Sadie, who could now hope to escape from the toils
of her enemies, for she knew that the forest was to the Indian
girl as easy to tread as a ball-room floor for her. She
returned the caresses showered upon her, and for a moment
the two girls forgot that aught of evil or danger hung over
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been to my father&rsquo;s camp,&rdquo; said Minneoba, &ldquo;and
many warriors are searching for you. Black-Hawk loves
the Wild Rose for her father&rsquo;s sake, and will give her a
shelter. His heart is very sad because the men of Garrett
have killed the good white man, but what can he do? The
war has commenced and the warriors would say he had
turned woman if he was angry at the death of a white man.
Let us go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two girls set out together, threading the mazes of the
forest with an ease which only a forest life could impart, the
Indian girl taking the advance, and chatting merrily with
her companion as she proceeded. They had not gone far
when they were met by two warriors, who expressed their
satisfaction in their peculiar manner, and at once led the
way to the river, which was not far away, and where a
canoe was waiting in which they descended the stream, a
distance of about three miles, landed upon a green point,
and assisted Sadie to leave the canoe, which was then carefully
concealed by leaves and brush. This done, the warriors
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
again led the way, the two girls following, and they
came suddenly upon a great camp of the Indians. More
than four hundred people, principally fighting braves, although
there was a small number of women and children,
were resting in the beautiful glade, most of them engaged in
cleaning their weapons and getting ready for the battle
which was to come. Black-Hawk and Will Jackwood were
conversing together apart from the rest, and the latter started
forward with a look of delight as he saw Sadie, and advanced
at once, closely followed by Black-Hawk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome to the Indian camp, Sadie,&rdquo; said Jackwood,
endeavoring to take her hand. &ldquo;You can not tell how unhappy
I have been since I knew that you were lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took no notice of his extended hand, but went on to
meet Black-Hawk, who greeted her kindly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the Wild Rose rest under the shelter of a Sac lodge,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Black-Hawk has been driven from the places
he loved by the white men, but he can not forget that
there are just white men, who would not do a wrong to the
simple Indian. Such a man was the father of the Wild
Rose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Black-Hawk,&rdquo; said Sadie, as she took the proffered hand,
&ldquo;when my father drove away the bad men who sought your
life, you promised to be a friend to us. Now the time has
come for you to keep your word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Black-Hawk is not a white man, to speak with a double
tongue. What he has spoken&mdash;he <i>has</i> spoken. Let the
Wild Rose ask what she will from Black-Hawk, and if it is
in his power, she shall have what she asks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father is dead,&rdquo; she said, mournfully. &ldquo;The bad men
who follow William Jackwood, killed him because he would
not kneel to them or beg for his life. Now, Jackwood follows
me and I fear him, and I ask the protection of the great
chief from this bad man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has the son of Red-Bird lied to me?&rdquo; cried Black-Hawk,
sternly. &ldquo;He told me that the Wild Rose loved him and
would come into his lodge gladly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has lied,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;He knows that I hate
him above all men on earth, and that I would die sooner than
permit myself to be his wife.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful, girl,&rdquo; hissed Jackwood. &ldquo;You will raise a
tempest which you can not quell, if you do not look out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no fear of the result. Any thing would be preferable
to a union with such a wretch as you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look you, Black-Hawk,&rdquo; cried Jackwood, turning fiercely
upon the chief. &ldquo;When I agreed to aid you, remember that
I told you that this girl must be mine and you promised that
I should have my will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was when Black-Hawk believed that the Wild Rose
loved you,&rdquo; replied Black-Hawk. &ldquo;She has asked for my
protection and it is given. Let the son of Red-Bird seek
another mate; the Wild Rose is not for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A tempest of furious passions raged in the heart of William
Jackwood. At any other time or place he would have
shot the old chief down without any remorse, and even here,
in the midst of his warriors, he was tempted to do it, even
at the risk of his own life. With a mighty effort he restrained
himself, and turned away with a malevolent glance
at Sadie, which she returned by one of defiance.</p>
<p>Several of the principal braves were looking on, and there
was some murmuring, for these men recognized the good old
maxim&mdash;&lsquo;to the victor belong the spoils.&rsquo; While they stood
thus, there was heard a triumphant shout upon the river, and
several men started away to see what it meant. They were
soon heard coming back, and directly after a compact body
of men, those who followed Will Jackwood, poured into the
camp, leading in their midst, as prisoners, Captain Melton,
Cooney Joe and Tom Bantry. A look of ferocious joy
beamed upon the face of Will Jackwood, for he saw a chance
for revenge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER XII.</span>
<br />SADIE&rsquo;S SACRIFICE.</h2>
<p>The prisoners marched firmly, and not a cheek blanched
as they saw where they were led and realized the fearful
danger in which they stood. Will Jackwood started forward
and addressed one of his subordinates, who, for the time
being, had been in command of the band.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did <i>you</i> take them, Justin? If you can say that you
did so without aid from the Indians, then you may ask any
thing you like at my hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nary red,&rdquo; replied the man. &ldquo;We caught them crossing
the river in a canoe, and pounced on &rsquo;em almost before they
could lift a hand, but that Cooney Joe laid out Jack Ferguson,
and Saul Sloan has got a bad wound in the shoulder, from
Melton&rsquo;s knife. Is that satisfactory?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellent! Black-Hawk, I claim these prisoners as my
own, as my men took them without help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are yours,&rdquo; replied Black-Hawk. &ldquo;An Indian
chief knows how to be just.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, Captain Charles Melton, you are in my power;
do you understand, in my power! You shall rue the day
when you dared come between me and the woman I love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, renegade?&rdquo; replied the young scout.
&ldquo;I never wronged you in my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps; we shall see how it turns out. Keep them
safe, boys; set a double guard upon them, and for your lives,
let none escape. Ah, my good, valiant, chivalric Joe, how
you will repent having raised your hand against me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do repent, Will,&rdquo; said Joe, quietly. &ldquo;I repent most
awfully. I ought to have lifted yer ha&rsquo;r on the spot, by
gracious. &rsquo;Twould have served you just right, and saved a
good deal of trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take them away, boys, take them away. Ha; don&rsquo;t let
the girl speak to them or she will contrive some way to set
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
them free. Look out for Minneoba above all others, for she
is as cute as the devil. Miss Sadie, do I deceive myself when
I think that you will not <i>now</i> disdain to hold some conversation
with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you wish to say to me, sir?&rdquo; replied Sadie, who
saw the dreadful peril of her friends, and wished to save
them if possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say to Black-Hawk that you wish to speak to me apart
from the rest and he will give you permission. I see a way
in which you can save these men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke to the chief, who nodded kindly, and she followed
Black Will a little distance from the camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is far enough,&rdquo; she said, pausing under a great tree.
&ldquo;What have you to say to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Change your way of speaking; be more complaisant to
me, my dear girl, for the more kindly you use me the better
it will be for yonder men who are doomed beyond hope if
I so much as lift a finger. First of all&mdash;do you love this
Captain Melton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has never spoken to me,&rdquo; replied Sadie. &ldquo;How do I
know that he cares for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not the question at issue. Do you love him?
That is what I asked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I answer that, when I do not know my own
heart? He is a brave and good man, and I could love him
dearly if he loved me as well. I will say no more upon that
point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least you care enough for him to wish to save his
life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes; I would do almost any thing for that,&rdquo; she replied,
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has gone as far as that, has it? My dear girl, you are
further gone than you imagined. Now, I do not wish to be
incumbered by prisoners. If we can not come to terms, I
shall find it necessary to put these fellows out of the way,
and shall certainly do so. There are many ways in which to
do this, and my friends the Indians will doubtless be happy
to take the laboring oar out of my hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that you would be base enough to give them
up to the torture?&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly, my Indian friends might find it in their
hearts to burn them if they only had them. I was present
at a spectacle of this kind, the other day, where they barbecued
a traitorous Indian. It was not pretty, and I may say
did not amuse me after the first gush, and I went so far as to
kill the poor fellow with my own hand, to put him out of his
pain. It would distress me very much to see any of your
friends in a like delicate situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you ask of me, William Jackwood? Do you
wish to drive me mad? You could not&mdash;<i>could</i> not be so
base.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would do any thing for revenge,&rdquo; replied the man,
hoarsely. &ldquo;I tell you, upon my honor as a man, that if you
do not promise to be my wife&mdash;I know that you will keep
your word&mdash;these men shall all die as I have said. Make that
promise, and upon the day when you become my wife, all shall
be set free except one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which one do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom Bantry; he is a cursed traitor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That man must be saved, at all hazards,&rdquo; replied Sadie,
firmly. &ldquo;Of all your villainous band, William Jackwood, he
alone showed a spark of pity when my unhappy father was
cast into the furious flood, bound and helpless. What I would
not do for love I will do for gratitude, and I give you my
hand, if you will swear upon your honor that these men shall
go free, and at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are sensible,&rdquo; he said, eagerly. &ldquo;I had not hoped
that you would yield so easily, and I will make it the study
of my life to make you happy as&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence! Give me your promise and I will give you
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I swear by the only things I hold pure&mdash;the memory of
my mother and my love for you&mdash;that these men shall all be
spared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I promise to be your wife, if we both live. Oh,
God, forgive me if I do wrong in this, but I can not see these
brave men sacrificed, who have come into this deadly peril
for my sake. William Jackwood, understand me fully, and
do not say in the after times that I deceived you. I hate
you&mdash;I shall always hate you&mdash;but I will be your wife.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Jackwood, with a light laugh. &ldquo;I will
try to change your opinion of me when we are married. And
now you are at liberty, and I will leave it to you to tell Black-Hawk
that you have changed your mind, while I prepare to
leave him. The chief has not used me well, and I do not
fight the battles of those who do not treat me as a friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went away with drooping head, and he stood in the
same spot, moodily tapping his boot-leg with a small switch
he carried. He was not fully satisfied, although he had gained
the stake for which he had been playing so long. She had
told him that she hated him, and had as good as said she
loved Charles Melton, and yet had promised to be his wife.
As he stood there, a man panting for breath and bleeding
from several wounds, rushed up to him, and in his disfigured
countenance he saw something which reminded him of Dick
Garrett, and stopped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick, what is the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Played out!&rdquo; replied Dick, dropping exhausted on the sod.
&ldquo;Give me some rum, for I am half dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jackwood put his flask to the mouth of the exhausted man
and he drank long and eagerly, and drew a deep breath of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah-h-h! That goes to the spot, Will. I&rsquo;ve had a long
run&mdash;chased by the devil&rsquo;s kid, and it&rsquo;s a mercy that I have
got in alive. It all came of chasing that accursed girl, who
got into the woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not your fault, Dick,&rdquo; said Jackwood. &ldquo;Minneoba
came in and told us about it, and we sent out parties
after her, and one of them picked her up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take care of her yourself, after this,&rdquo; panted Dick. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
seen the devil to-day, and fought him, and I don&rsquo;t want any
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are the rest of your men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone under, I reckon. Jack Fish and Tracey got into
the woods, and the rest are dead. I had to play &rsquo;possum, or
I would have been cooked, too. Give me another drink, and
I&rsquo;ll tell you about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jackwood gave him the flask, and for a moment nothing
was heard except the musical gurgle of the liquor. When
he lowered it, a considerable vacuum existed in the vessel,
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
and he told the story of the chase after Sadie with many expletives
not necessary to set down here. When he had
finished the tale he did the same with the liquor, and stood
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are wounded, Dick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing of much account. I&rsquo;ve been cut and scratched
in diving through the brushes, for that hairy cuss chased me
almost into camp. I thought he&rsquo;d never give it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who or what it can be,&rdquo; said Jackwood,
musingly, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t care much. Go and wash the blood
from your face, and then get the men together, for we must
leave this camp. It is all up with Black-Hawk, for Atkinson
has come with an army, and he will clean out the Indians in
the twinkling of an eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Garrett moved away slowly, and Jackwood advanced to
the side of Black-Hawk, who was talking with Sadie. She
did not look at him as he came up, but Minneoba faced him
boldly, with her pretty face showing the utmost anger and
contempt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has the son of Red-Bird said to frighten the Wild
Rose?&rdquo; she cried, angrily. &ldquo;He is a coward and no brave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better send your daughter away, Black-Hawk,&rdquo;
said Jackwood, quietly. &ldquo;I have borne insults enough in
this camp, and will not stay here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The son of Red-Bird promised to stay and fight for his
red brothers,&rdquo; said Black-Hawk, reproachfully, &ldquo;and when
he sees the enemy in sight he runs away like a frightened
hound. It is well; Black-Hawk would not have any except
brave men follow him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is false, Indian,&rdquo; cried Will Jackwood. &ldquo;Here, in the
midst of your wild band, I defy you to prove that while you
were true to me, I failed to do my duty like a man. But
when you dared to take away my prisoner, my wife that is
to be, in that day I leave you, never to return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go,&rdquo; replied Black-Hawk. &ldquo;I have been deceived in
the son of Red-Bird. His father died in the white man&rsquo;s
prison, and now he basely turns away when the battle is
nigh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay with me, Wild Rose,&rdquo; cried Minneoba. &ldquo;My father
is a strong chief and will protect you from harm.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can not&mdash;I dare not,&rdquo; replied Sadie. &ldquo;If I stay with
you, my friends, who are his prisoners, must die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father will take them away from him,&rdquo; said Minneoba,
looking pleadingly at the old chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him do so&mdash;let him make himself a dog, if he dares,&rdquo;
replied Jackwood. &ldquo;I will tell his baseness throughout the
tribes, and not a man of them all dare look me in the face
until I am righted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chief hung his head, for he had pledged his sacred
word that Jackwood should keep his prisoners. The scoundrel
knew his character too well to doubt for a moment that
the Indian would keep his word, and let them go away with
the prisoners. Minneoba pleaded in vain, and with loud lamenting,
followed the compact force of Jackwood to the edge
of the forest, and saw them go away with the prisoners, closely
guarded, and Sadie walking by the side of William Jackwood,
with a hard, bitter look upon her beautiful face. Garrett,
who recovered quickly from every evil, turned about
and blew a kiss at Minneoba, who at once fitted an arrow to
the string, and would have sent it after him, but that he took
shelter among the men, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The world is all before us where to choose,&rsquo; boys,&rdquo; said
Jackwood, &ldquo;but one thing is certain, if this thing goes against
the Indians, and of course it will, this territory won&rsquo;t be very
healthy for us. What do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find a place to live, Cap,&rdquo; replied Garrett. &ldquo;The
world owes us a living, and we&rsquo;ll have it too, or else make
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think we had better find a hiding-place and
see what is going to happen? There will be pretty pickings
for us if the day should, by any chance, favor the Indians,
even for a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know the place you mean, Cap,&rdquo; said Jack Fish, who
had come in before they marched. &ldquo;The neatest hiding-place
in the West.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Bout six mile, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lead the way, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fish took the advance, and Jackwood assisted the weary
steps of Sadie over the rugged road before them. It led
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
through tangled thickets, under trees which had been the
growth of centuries, and ended in a circular forest opening,
so difficult to reach, that Black Will was obliged to carry Sadie
in places, so worn out had she become.</p>
<p>The grass was green in the little glade, and the birds
were singing, as one by one the troop came out from beneath
the canopy of leaves, and gained a footing on the level
turf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack Fish,&rdquo; said the renegade, &ldquo;you have deserved well
of your country. I could live here forever. Here we rest,
until the thing is decided one way or another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How will we live?&rdquo; queried Garrett.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The woods are full of game, and we will kill it so far
from the camp, that no one will suspect us of being here.
Captain Melton, will you give me your word of honor not to
try to escape, provided I free your arms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Melton was about to refuse, but catching Sadie&rsquo;s eye, he
changed his mind, and made the required promise. It was
not extended to Tom Bantry, and Cooney Joe, who were
tightly bound, and placed under guard. Sadie was coming
forward with the intention of speaking to Melton, when the
bushes parted near her, and the face of the demon of the
woods appeared, peeping out among the leaves.</p>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIII.</span>
<br />GUESTS NOT INVITED.</h2>
<p>Sadie was not easily frightened, but it required the effort
of all her resolution to keep her from uttering a cry of
alarm. The young captain saw that she was deeply moved and
ascribed it to her grief at the situation in which she found
herself placed. But she recovered herself by a great effort
of the will and came forward, giving her hand frankly to the
man she loved and who loved her as dearly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am deeply grieved that you have come into this danger
for my sake, Charles,&rdquo; she said, softly. &ldquo;But have no
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
fear, for I will save you at any hazard. Indeed, it is done
already, for I have given my word and you are safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Safe! What do you mean, Sadie; what promise have
you given?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not be angry with me, Charles,&rdquo; she said, sadly. &ldquo;I
am sorry that it is forced upon me but&mdash;I have promised to
be the wife of William Jackwood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Black Will! Gracious heaven, Sadie, it cannot be. What
madness is this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was forced to do it. They threatened you and your
brave companions with a horrible death. I had no one near
to advise me and I could not&mdash;I could not see you die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should have spoken to me first,&rdquo; he cried, wildly.
&ldquo;You knew that I loved you. I have never dared to tell
you until now, and ought to have spoken. What is death to
dishonor? What a life you have doomed yourself to
bear, that I may live. I would sooner die a thousand deaths
than bear this bitter burden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charles!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You make my load too heavy
for me to bear. How could I see those who had incurred
this peril for me, given up to satisfy the bloody passions of
these desperate men. My father is dead&mdash;I am alone in the
world and my life would have been a weary one at best, if
I had refused to yield. He told me that if I was obstinate,
I should stand by and see you suffer. I could not have borne
that, at any rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should have remained in the camp of Black-Hawk,
who is a brave man, although an Indian. My dear girl, I
can not blame you for what you have done. It was in all
kindness of heart, but it was wrong for you to yield. The
lives of men who are ready at any time to die for the right
should be as a feather&rsquo;s weight compared to your sacrifice.
As I say, so would Joe Bent and Tom Bantry, who are more
hated by these men than I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you not escape?&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;But no&mdash;I forgot.
My word is pledged to this bad man and that I hold
sacred. But I shall not deem it a crime to take his life, and
although he may claim my hand he shall never have a
wife&rsquo;s duty from me&mdash;for I hate him&mdash;oh, how I hate him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The white teeth clicked together fiercely as she spoke,
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
and Black Will, who was listening, laughed a low, bitter laugh,
full of malice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry to interfere in a social meeting of this kind,&rdquo; he
said, advancing, &ldquo;but your language is disgusting to your
future husband, my dear Sadie. Captain Melton, if I hear
any more language of this kind from you, I shall have you
bound and gagged, for I will not endure it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you do that it absolves me from my promise, for you
gave me your word to treat them well,&rdquo; said Sadie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not give you even that loop-hole from which to
escape,&rdquo; said Black Will, after a pause. &ldquo;I leave the camp
to-day in search of a man who is at one of the Indian stations,
a Lutheran missionary. Let me say to you that he is
a man who would not perform the ceremony if you offer a
word of objection, and that you have only to say &lsquo;no,&rsquo; and
that ceremony will cease and one of another kind commence,
for as there is a sky above us I will take your friends out
and hang them before your eyes. Git my horse, Jack
Fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man obeyed, and after giving some orders to Dick
Garrett in a low tone, the renegade mounted and rode away
through the wood.</p>
<p>Two days passed, and they heard nothing of him. Upon
the afternoon of the third he came into camp accompanied
by a pale, intellectual-looking man in the dress of a clergyman,
who looked mildly about on the wild group in the
camp, evidently surprised to find himself in such a place.
He was at once conducted to one of the brush cabins which
had been built up by the men, while Black Will dismounted
and ordered that Melton and the other prisoners should be
removed into the woods a short distance from the camp, for
he knew the missionary too well to believe that he would
perform the ceremony if he had any doubt of the willingness
of the lady to do her part, and Black Will feared the prisoners
might let him know the true state of the case.</p>
<p>Five men accompanied the prisoners into the woods, with
orders to shoot them down at the first attempt to escape.
When this was done Black Will approached the brush cabin
in which Sadie spent the time, and called her out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have returned,&rdquo; he said, cheerfully. &ldquo;You must excuse
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
me for staying away from you so long, but I found it
difficult to find the missionary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only wish you had never found him or had received
your just deserts, sir,&rdquo; was the somewhat unpromising reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My deserts; I deserve better treatment at your hands, I
think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twelve feet of rope and a tree would suit you better,&rdquo;
she replied. &ldquo;Do not deceive yourself by the belief that I
shall ever change in my regard for you. The most slimy
reptile which crawls through the swamp would be to me a
more pleasant companion. I give my hand to you to save
my friends, but never my heart with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood moodily before her, tapping his boot with the
riding-whip he carried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have half a mind to refuse your hand upon these
terms,&rdquo; he said, gloomily, without raising his eyes from the
earth upon which they were bent. &ldquo;Your language is horrible
to one to whom you are about to join yourself for life,
and the day will surely come when you will repent it bitterly.
There, I will say no more now; but, in half an hour
I shall come for you and we will be married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need not fear but I will keep my word,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Will you keep yours as well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never broke it yet to friend or foe,&rdquo; was his answer,
&ldquo;and I do not mean to commence now. When you have
given me your hand in marriage, these men shall have two
days&rsquo; grace, but if I catch them after that, woe be to them,
that is all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned upon his heel and left her to her own reflections,
which were not of the most pleasant type. At times
she doubted her firmness in the hour of trial, and whether
she would not give way in the presence of the missionary,
but the thought of his fearful threat against her lover and
friends nerved her, and she determined to bear up as bravely
as she could, and make the sacrifice for their safety. She
would have liked to see Melton once before the ceremony,
but feared that she was not strong enough to endure the
meeting. While she sat there with her face buried in her
hands, Black Will came for her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;There is one favor I would ask you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and it
is one you can easily grant. You know I love Charles Melton,
but all thoughts of him must pass in the moment when
I put my hand in yours. Under the circumstances he must
not see me again, and I could not bear to see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agreed; you shall not see him, and if he dares to attempt
an interview when you are once my wife, it will be the
worse for him. I have removed him already, and they wait
in the woods until the ceremony is over, when they shall be
allowed to go where they will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do, sir. Now I am ready, if you will not relent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head savagely, and taking her hand led
her out into the open space among the trees. The band
were standing carelessly about, looking on as the two took
their station before the missionary, who advanced book in
hand and stood before them.</p>
<p>He recited that portion of the ritual which was necessary before
he asked the question, &ldquo;and if any know just cause or reason
why these should not be joined together in the bands of holy
wedlock, let them now speak or forever after hold their
peace,&rdquo; when the crowd scattered before the rush of a strong
man, and the gigantic figure of the Forest Fiend sprung into
the circle and hurled Black Will ten paces backward by a
single thrust of his powerful arm, while he cried, fiercely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forbid the banns!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down with him,&rdquo; roared Black Will, drawing his knife.
&ldquo;At him, boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back!&rdquo; cried the strange being, &ldquo;back, for your lives.
It is not right that innocence and youth should be forced
to wed with such a thing as this, and I forbid it. Back, I say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They recoiled before the stern figure, especially those
among them who had felt the nervous force of his strong
arm, while Black Will looked at the clergyman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not mind the ravings of a madman, sir,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;this man is insane and knows not what he does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is false, reverend sir,&rdquo; replied the Forest Fiend. &ldquo;I
am as sane a man as any here, and know whereof I speak.
Fall back, men; don&rsquo;t press upon me. Ha, they will have
it, then. Melton&rsquo;s Scout to the rescue!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>As the tones of his sonorous voice rung out through the
deep forest, there came a charging cheer, and the buck-skin
shirts and coon-skin caps of Melton&rsquo;s Scout showed through
the leafy cover, and with wild cries they poured upon the
foe.</p>
<p>Not a shot was fired, for Sadie, the missionary and the
Forest Fiend stood in the midst of the enemy, and the Scout
dared not fire. But as the enemy retreated, snatching up
their weapons as they went, at a signal from the Forest Fiend,
Sadie and the missionary fell upon their faces, and the Scout
poured in a single withering volley which strewed the ground
with dead and dying, and then charged upon the foe with
knife, hatchet and pistol.</p>
<p>The Forest Fiend caught up a rifle from the earth, and
using it as a club, headed the charge. Close behind him came
Charles Melton, Cooney Joe and Tom Bantry, striking out
manfully for the right, and felling an adversary at every blow.
But none could equal the strange being known as the Forest
Fiend. Taking the ponderous rifle in one hand, he made it
play about his head with lightning rapidity, and the renegades
went down before him like chaff before the wind.</p>
<p>Taken by surprise, it was no wonder that the retreat soon
became a rout, and they scattered to the four winds, closely
pursued by their determined assailants. One man, and that
man Dick Garrett, dared to bar the way of the Forest Fiend,
who paused with uplifted weapon and looked at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last, villain,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;your time has come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vain was the interposition of the rifle of the renegade to
stay the blow. It descended upon his head, and Dick Garrett,
the friend and companion in villainy of Will Jackwood
lay dead at the avenger&rsquo;s feet. At this moment a cry of
anger was heard, and turning, the strange man saw that Jackwood
was on horseback, headed for the bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire at him,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Bring him down at all hazards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half a dozen bullets sped, but Jackwood was already in
the thicket, and all pursuit was vain. Five minutes later the
fight was over, and few of Black Will&rsquo;s band remained to
tell the tale of that terrible day.</p>
<p>The Forest Fiend turned back to the place where Sadie
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
stood, encircled by the arm of Charles Melton, and she drew
closer to her lover as she marked his terrible aspect. Raising
his hand to his face, he tore off the hairy mask which covered
it, and revealed the face of&mdash;<i>Samuel Wescott</i>!</p>
<p>Her father, redeemed from a watery grave! In an instant
Sadie was in his arms, half-delirious with joy, and the tried
friends gathered about him, eager to shake his hand, while
Cooney Joe and Tom Bantry danced a comic hornpipe, uttering
yells which would have done credit to Sac warriors on
the war-trail.</p>
<p>When the first transport of the meeting was over, Samuel
Wescott turned to Tom Bantry and shook him warmly by the
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did your best to save me, my friend,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but
I knew that both must perish if I clung to you. I went down,
as you know, and coming to the surface, in a death-struggle I
caught a floating log, which quickly bore me down the stream,
and I had not the strength to land until I had been carried
two miles down. Near this place I had a <i>cache</i>, in which,
among other articles, was this disguise, which I have sometimes
worn in my expeditions among the tribes, and I knew
that it might aid me in the work before me. Had I known
that it would frighten my daughter so much, I would have
shown my face when I attacked the men who guarded her,
while you were fighting in the swamp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s enough to skeer the life out of any critter,&rdquo; said
Cooney Joe. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder she run from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has served its purpose. I followed you to this place,
Sadie, and having satisfied myself that those I loved were in
no immediate danger, I went back for the Scout, the position
of whose camp I knew. We came up softly, set Melton, Joe
and Tom at liberty, and then attacked these scoundrels. The
rest you know as well as I. There is only one thing for
which I am sorry, and that is, that this villain Jackwood has
escaped. But his fate will find him out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half an hour later they were on their way to the river,
guarded by Melton&rsquo;s Scout. The last week had been one of
trial, but they had come out of the flame triumphant, and the
power of Black Will Jackwood was broken forever. As they
reached the river-bank, and the men were bringing up the
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
flat in which they were to cross, Minneoba suddenly appeared
from the forest, and fell upon Sadie&rsquo;s neck, weeping for
joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Minneoba can bear any thing now, the breaking of her
people, the loss of home, for her sister is safe. Good-by, and
do not forget the poor Indian girl who loves you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with us,&rdquo; said Samuel Wescott. &ldquo;I will give you
a shelter in my house until the war is at an end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Minneoba shook her head sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The Indian girl must not leave her father,
who loves her. Go in peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They parted from her sadly, and as the flat receded from
the shore, they saw her standing in a dejected attitude, leaning
on her bow. It was many a day before they saw her
again.</p>
<p class="tb">The battle was at its hight. Black-Hawk had risked all
upon a cast of the die, and had found it a losing game. Melton,
Cooney Joe and Tom Bantry were there, fighting gallantly,
and as the Indians began to break up, they charged a
resolute knot of warriors who stood their ground stubbornly,
dealing death on every side.</p>
<p>There was a moment of wild confusion, and Charles Melton
found himself face to face with a desperate man, in his
war-paint, who assailed him with demoniac fury. Just then
Melton&rsquo;s horse fell, shot through the heart, and his adversary
sprung at him with a wild cry of joy, raising a hatchet above
his devoted head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Death to you, Melton,&rdquo; he screamed. &ldquo;I am Will Jackwood,
and you die by my hand. If I lost her, at least you
shall never possess her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Melton, pinned to the earth by his fallen horse, lifted his
hand to ward off the blow, but hampered as he was he could
offer but slight resistance, and the knife, his only defense,
was forced from his hand, and the hatchet gleamed above
him.</p>
<p>He had just time to catch the gleam of ferocious joy in the
eyes of his enemy, and had given up hope, when a rifle
cracked, and Jackwood, throwing up his arms, clutched at
the bloody cloth upon his breast, tried once more to lift his
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
weapon, and then, with a snarl of demoniac malice, dropped
dead in his tracks, while Cooney Joe, with a rifle smoking in
his hand, ran to aid his fallen leader, who was quickly placed
upon his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; cried Joe, angrily. &ldquo;Ha! Black Will, by
the mortal. Rubbed out at last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was his epitaph. He died as he had lived, boldly and
defiantly, and found a soldier&rsquo;s grave.</p>
<p>The power of Black-Hawk was broken, and the old chief
a fugitive, soon to be a prisoner in the hands of the whites.
Then it was that Samuel Wescott kept his promise to Minneoba,
and gave her a shelter under his roof. The teachings
of Sadie soon changed the forest maiden so much, that she
loved a domestic life, and when Sadie was married, soon after
Black-Hawk&rsquo;s visit to the east, Minneoba was there, and witnessed
the ceremony. When it was finished, Cooney Joe
stopped the clergyman:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop a little, stranger,&rdquo; he said, sheepishly. &ldquo;Got another
little job for you, I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And to the surprise of all, Minneoba took his hand, and
they were married.</p>
<p>Unknown to every one, Joe had obtained the consent of
the old chief, who knew that his daughter was better fitted
to live with the whites than with the tribes, and Minneoba
became the wife of Joe Bent. She never had cause to repent
it. Rough though he was, he was a true man, and worked
nobly for her sake, and strange as it may seem, became in
time, one of the richest farmers in that region.</p>
<p>Captain Melton also settled there, and the two families
were constantly together. And above the mantel, in Melton&rsquo;s
study, hangs the costume of the Forest Fiend.</p>
<p>Tom Bantry was for years a successful boatman upon the
Mississippi, and at last a Captain. Samuel Wescott died at a
green old age, honored and beloved by all who knew him.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
